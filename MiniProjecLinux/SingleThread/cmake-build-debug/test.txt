An English Story by Noel White

Yasin’s family moved from Iraq to England when he was just a young boy. Yasin did not want to leave his home in Samarra but his father said that it was best for the family because it was not safe to live there anymore and he wanted his son to grow up in a country that was accepting of all people. Yasin’s father told his son that England was a multicultural country where people lived and worked together regardless of race or religious beliefs.

Although Yasin was not happy about leaving Iraq, he soon settled into his new life in a big city called London. London was very exciting with its tall buildings and museums, and Yasin especially liked the London Planetarium and the big River Thames with all of its old bridges.

Yasin even made friends with a boy who lived next door called Andrew. All summer long Andrew and Yasin played in the park or went to the zoo with Andrew’s mum. Andrew shared his toys and his comics with Yasin and told him all about his favourite superheroes. They even built a camp in Yasin’s back garden where they would hide from the grownups.

The summer was a fun time and young Yasin soon felt quite at home in London even though it was a very big city and not nearly as sunny and hot as it was in Samarra. His English got better and better, especially with help from Andrew, although there were a lot of words that Yasin did not understand and he often felt silly because he could not speak as well as he would like.

When September finally came around and the leaves began to fall from the trees, Yasin’s father explained that it was time for his son to go to school. Yasin was seven years old so he would be going to year three of the local primary school – the same year as his friend Andrew!

Although Yasin was very nervous about going to school, his father and mother assured him that it would be a fun place where he would meet lots of new friends and learn lots of interesting new things. ‘English schools are supposed to be very good,’ said Yasin’s mother.

‘And you will learn some very interesting things and your English will get better in no time,’ assured his father.

Yasin was still not convinced, but when Andrew knocked on the door that morning with a big smile on his face saying how fun it was going to be at school, Yasin felt much better because he trusted his friend.

The two boys chatted all the way to the school gates: Andrew told Yasin about the playground and who was the best teacher and what boys were the most fun and what girls were pretty and how they often served custard for pudding at lunchtimes. Yasin did not know what custard was, but Andrew looked very excited about it so Yasin thought it must taste very good.

But when the boys got to their class, things did not go how Yasin imagined they would. The teacher told Andrew to take a seat at the front of the class as she introduced Yasin to the rest of the children. He did not like standing up in front of the class and one boy shouted out that he was a smelly foreigner. The boys and girls all laughed, and then another boy made fun of Yasin’s accent when he was asked to say his name and where he came from. ‘I can’t understand him, miss. He can’t even speak English,’ said the nasty boy.

Finally Yasin was allowed to take a seat at the back of the class, but he wished that he was next to Andrew as he felt very alone. The girl sitting beside him kept looking at him in a strange way that made Yasin uncomfortable, and during the lesson she put her hand up and asked the teacher if she could move places. Yasin did not understand what he had done to offend the girl.

When the bell went it was time to go out into the playground. All of the children closed their books and put on their coats and headed out of the door into the bright autumn sunshine. The teacher kept Yasin back for a moment and gave him a badge with his name on which she pinned to his jumper. ‘There you go,’ she said with a smile. ‘Now all of the children will be able to learn your name.’

Yasin thought that the badge looked silly, and when he went out into the playground all of the children began pointing and laughing. ‘You’ve got a girl’s name,’ said a small boy with curly blond hair.

Yasin wanted to explain that it was not a girl’s name but he was too nervous because all of the children were pointing at him and laughing. When Yasin got nervous his English was not very good and the words always got stuck in his throat. He was very sad and wanted to run out of the playground back to his mother and father and never return to school again. But just as he was about to run, he heard a familiar voice. ‘Hi Yasin.’ And when he looked up there was Andrew standing right beside him.

Andrew looked at the children gathered around and shook his head. ‘What’s wrong with you lot?’ he asked. ‘I told my friend Yasin that school was fun. Why are you ruining it for him?’

‘He’s different,’ said a very tall girl who was standing at the front of the crowd of children.

‘So are you,’ said Andrew. ‘You are the tallest girl in the whole school and you don’t like it when people make fun of you, do you?’

Then Andrew looked at the boy with the curly hair. ‘And you don’t like it when people say that you have girl’s hair,’ he said to the boy. ‘We are all different and that is what makes us interesting. What would life be like if we were all the same as one another?’

There was silence among the children. Then Yasin lifted his head high. ‘Boring,’ he said with a smile.

‘That’s right!’ exclaimed Andrew, returning his friend’s smile. ‘Flippin’ boring!’

And with that all of the children began to laugh. ‘Flippin’ boring,’ they chanted at one another.

Andrew went on to explain how he had spent the summer with Yasin, how they had built a camp together and played in the park, and how Yasin preferred Batman to Superman, and how he really was different because he didn’t even like hotdogs!

The children all laughed some more and soon everybody was talking about all the things that made them different from one another. Peter Jenkins even lifted up his jumper and showed everybody a big purple birthmark on the front of his belly. ‘Now that’s what I call different,’ he said triumphantly. ‘I bet none of you have a big birthmark like mine!’

When break time was over, Andrew put his hand up in class and suggested to the teacher that they should spend the lesson talking about how great it was that everybody was so different from everybody else and how people came to England from all over the world to begin a new life like his friend Yasin. The teacher agreed that it was important to be an individual, and she also said how wonderful it was that the whole of Britain was such a multicultural island. Yasin wrote these two words down in his book and promised himself that he would learn them both and remember them always. He also wrote the word friend in his book. He already knew what friend meant, but he just wanted to write it down because he felt so lucky to have a good friend like Andrew who stood up for people and did not judge them just because they were different.

Having a Best Friend


A story tells that two friends were walking through the desert. During some point of the journey, they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.

The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand “Today my best friend slapped me in the face”.

They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone “Today my best friend saved my life”.

The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him, “After I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now, you write on a stone, why?” The other friend replied “When someone hurts us we should write it down in the sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But, when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.”

Moral: Do not value the things you have in your life. But value who you have in your life.

Long Story Short
Lydia Davis’s radical fiction.

By Dana Goodyear

Illustration by Chang Park / Photograph by David Levenson / Getty
Somewhere in the files of General Mills is a letter from the very-short-story writer Lydia Davis. In it, Davis, who is widely considered one of the most original minds in American fiction today, expresses dismay at the packaging of the frozen peas sold by the company’s subsidiary Cascadian Farm. The letter, like many things that Davis writes, had started out sincere and then turned weird. Details grew overly specific; a narrative, however spare, emerged. “The peas are a dull yellow green, more the color of pea soup than fresh peas and nothing like the actual color of your peas, which are a nice bright dark green,” she wrote. “We have compared your depiction of peas to that of the other frozen peas packages and yours is by far the least appealing. . . . We enjoy your peas and do not want your business to suffer. Please reconsider your art.” Rather than address her complaint, the company sent her a coupon for Green Giant.
The story that resulted from her complaint, “Letter to a Frozen Peas Manufacturer,” is only a couple of hundred words long and appears in “Can’t and Won’t,” which comes out next month. “Can’t and Won’t” is Davis’s first collection since 2009, when her “Collected Stories” was published: some two hundred pieces, amounting to just seven hundred pages, thirty years’ worth of work. (Her novel, “The End of the Story,” was not included.) Before then, she had been known, if she was known, as “a writer’s writer’s writer”—dismissal by hyperbole. Some said her stories sounded like translations, vaguely alien. The “Collected” surprised people; taken together, her work—cerebral, witty, well built, homey, homely, sometimes vanishingly small—had heft. It was the kind of book that could be used, as one critic attested, to jack a car and change a flat. In May, Davis won the 2013 Man Booker International Prize, Britain’s highest literary award for a noncitizen. Michael Silverblatt, the erudite host of the Los Angeles radio show “Bookworm,” says, “Literary people know that at the sentence level and the word level she’s the best there is.”
Davis is sixty-six, with chin-length once blond hair, pale lashes, and eyes the color of blue milk glass. Her eyeglasses are lined with pink, like a conch. She wears small earrings in flattering shades of blue, and the loose, dark clothing of a city shrink. She works from life, in the way that Samuel Beckett did—life’s interactions partway estranged from their contexts—with a notebook always secreted in her purse. Her subjects can be humble to the point of mundanity: lost socks, car trips, neighbors, small fights. (“He said she was disagreeing with him. She said no, that was not true, he was disagreeing with her.”) According to the novelist Jonathan Franzen, “She is the shorter Proust among us. She has the sensitivity to track the stuff that is so evanescent it flies right by the rest of us. But as it does so it leaves enough of a trace that when you read her you do it with a sense of recognition.”
Davis lives with her husband, Alan Cote, an abstract painter, in a tiny village in Rensselaer County, New York. Cote is large, warm, taciturn, and wears a mustache. Their house is a converted elementary school, built in 1930 by the W.P.A.: neo-Georgian, brick, with Boston ivy and fifteen-foot ceilings. He paints in the gymnasium; the bathtub is in the teachers’ lounge. On the fence outside, a sign made from found sticks spells “L’Ecole.”
One recent morning, Davis sat at her kitchen table with a pocket-size black notebook and a hardcover novel by a popular writer, whom she asked me not to name. “I don’t like to hurt people’s feelings, and I don’t like to knock other writers as a matter of principle,” she said. Though enjoyably soap-operatic, the novel, that month’s selection for her book club—local women, wine, family talk—was full of mixed metaphors. “I’ve gotten very alert not just to mixed metaphor but to any writing mistake,” she said. “A little bell goes off in my head first. I know something’s wrong here. Then secondly I see what it is.” She opened the notebook and read a sentence about an acute intimacy that had eroded into something dull. “Acute is sharp, and then eroded is an earth metaphor,” she said. She read another: “ ‘A paper bag stuffed with empty wine bottles.’ I thought about that. You’d think he could get away with it, but he can’t, because ‘stuffed’ is a verb that comes from material. It’s soft, so it’s a problem to stuff it with something hard.” There were sentences about camouflaging with a veneer, and girding with an orb, and boomeranging parallels. “Whenever I read this kind of thing, it tells me the writer is not sensitive to the full value of the idea of comparison,” she said.
But to be curmudgeonly was not the point. As she was noting the mistakes, she kept flipping to the back jacket to look at the author’s photograph: a relaxed, good-looking man, smiling openly at the camera. A little idea started to take shape, enough for a one-line story. “I just write down one sentence,” she said. “This would be me assuming a kind of yenta voice: ‘Such a handsome young fellow to write such bad mixed metaphors.’ ” She smiled. “It’s me feeling a little sorry that I’m writing down all his mistakes, because he looks so friendly and nice and in a way innocent. Some author photos don’t look so innocent.”
In the summer of 1973, when Davis was twenty-six, she and her boyfriend Paul Auster went to live in the South of France, as caretakers of an eighteenth-century stone farmhouse with a red tile roof and an enclosed garden. They had been in Paris for two years already, translating French novels and poems and art catalogues and film scripts—sometimes the pay amounted to five dollars a page—and working assiduously on their own writing.
At Barnard, where Davis went to college, she had been a distracted student, occasionally accompanying Auster to his classes at Columbia rather than attending her own. (They met in the spring of their freshman year.) They played touch football and one-on-one basketball. Davis had long honey-colored hair and a dreamy affect. “She had pheromones, and men and boys followed her around panting,” an old friend said.
Auster was sunken-eyed and soulful, with a cocked eyebrow, or, as he puts it, “a dark-haired Jewish boy from New Jersey with a public-school education.” Davis had gone to Brearley, and then to Putney, a boarding school with farm work, in Vermont. Her father, Robert Gorham Davis, taught English at Columbia—modern short stories—and her mother, Hope Hale Davis, wrote fiction for women’s magazines and occasionally for The New Yorker. First they were Communists, then liberals (he was questioned by the House Committee on Un-American Activities); always they were avid party-givers. Lionel Trilling came to the apartment, Erica Jong, Grace Paley, Edward Said. In memoirs, Auster portrays himself as helplessly impressed by Davis, loving more than he was loved. He writes, “For the most part you were the pursuer, and she alternated between resisting your advances and wanting to be caught.” Among their friends—“arcane, avant-garde intellectuals,” Mitch Sisskind, who was one of them, said—Davis was the eccentric. “We were all reading Kafka,” he told me. “She read Kafka, too—and you can see the influence—but she also read ‘The Making of a Surgeon.’ ”
In the country, Auster wrote poems; Davis struggled to write traditional short stories, of the kind her parents admired. (Later, they would say, Why don’t you write about your travels or something more cheerful?) She copied out lines of Beckett to understand how the sentences functioned, and tacked them to the wall. The stories, however, were too masterly to imitate. She read mysteries, weighed herself, threw pebbles in an urn. She tried to make herself stay at her desk till lunch. Auster, on the other hand, could easily work all day.
At the end of August, Davis happened to read a strange little book of very short stories by the poet Russell Edson. Here was a contemporary, an American, whose stories, unlike those of her literary heroes, sometimes failed. Within days, she had started writing strange little stories of her own. She set a goal, two per day. “I didn’t think too hard about what I was going to do,” she told me. “I just snatched an idea from the air, I just went with it, and I didn’t think about what the meaning was of the story, and I still don’t like to do that.” She started to enjoy herself. A month after reading Edson, she wrote “The Thirteenth Woman,” a hundred-and-thirty-eight-word story in two sentences, which she sees as “the first seminal story.” The same day, she wrote “The Transformation,” a page-long fable about a woman who turns into a stone. She worked in a plain cardboard notebook, with a studied hand. “Must conquer this afternoon malaise,” one late-September entry starts, followed by six stories. “She would get an idea, three or four sentences or a paragraph, and she would write it clean off the top of her head and that would be it,” Auster told me. “The stuff she labored over never turned out as successfully.”
Anything Davis wrote might turn, unbidden, into fiction. In her notebook, she composed a letter to her friend Jack LeVert (part of their Kafka-reading, touch-football-playing crowd), who was planning to visit them at the farmhouse:
If you were to look in on us, you would be amazed at the elegance in which we live. You would see us sweep into the driveway in a pale green station wagon, casually pat our thoroughbreds as we entered our restored, pre-revolutionary home with its thick beams and red tiled floors. . . . You would see us during the day with dreamy looks in our eyes writing poetry and little dibs and dabs of nothing, as though we had been born to idleness. Perhaps I would invite you to go sketching and we would take the folding chairs and our pads of sketch paper. Perhaps later we would listen to an opera from where we lounged beside the bright medieval fireplace, our Labradors sleeping at our feet on their deerskin rug. But as dinnertime approached you would notice that we grew nervous. At first it would be hardly perceptible, the smallest haunted look in our eyes, a dark shadow on our faces. You would intercept embarrassed glances. I would blush suddenly and turn pale and when dinner arrived, though the pottery were of the finest quality, hand turned, and the mats from Japan and the napkins from India, the beans would stick in your throat, the carrots would break the tines of your fork and you would recognize the taste of cat. How much more painful is poverty for the caretakers. [cartoon id="a18051"]
The hardship was romantic, self-imposed. “We both came from families that had enough money to rescue us,” Davis said. “This was all our own choice, really. It was for our so-called art.” When they finally ran out of money, they returned to New York, nine dollars between them. Davis’s father helped get them an apartment on Riverside Drive, and they were married there in the fall of 1974. (Auster, in “Winter Journal,” a memoir: “Given the frequent changes of heart that had afflicted the two of you from the beginning, the constant comings and goings, the affairs with other people, the breakups and makeups that followed one another as regularly as the changing of the seasons, the thought that either one of you should have considered marriage at this point now strikes you as an act of delusional folly.” Davis: “I read about some town in Northern California, where the pastor at the church—or is it the law?—said you’re not allowed to get married without three or four visits to the pastoral counselor ahead of time to discuss your expectations or habits or needs. It’s worked out very well. People don’t get divorced.”) Davis briefly studied to become a speech therapist. Instead, she and Auster moved to Berkeley and published a collection of her pieces, “The Thirteenth Woman and Other Stories,” in an edition of five hundred. The poets in their circle loved it.
The following year, expecting a child, they bought an old house in Dutchess County—a cursed house, according to Auster, who found “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion” in a box on the back porch and a dried-up crow, like an omen, behind a chest of drawers. Their son, Daniel, was born in 1977, and when he was eighteen months old they separated. Auster moved back to the city, and, after they divorced, married the novelist Siri Hustvedt. Eventually, Davis moved back, too, and lived a few blocks from them in Brooklyn to make it easier for Daniel to go back and forth. Davis worked as a typesetter at a small Brooklyn newspaper; the checks the paper wrote her bounced.
The question of what constitutes a story is troublesome. E. M. Forster wrote, “ ‘The king died and then the queen died’ is a story. ‘The king died, and then the queen died of grief’ is a plot.” Davis’s stories have very little in the way of plot; sometimes people get indignant and ask her why she doesn’t call them poems or fragments. (She prefers the deeper associations of the word “story.”) Like thoughts, her pieces are reiterative; she sooner makes chronology a subject than a formal device. She says her work arises from a conjunction of humor, language, and emotional difficulty. Sometimes that means high culture, low culture, and animals; that is, a contradiction, plus the life force. Usually, she sets out to answer a single question and tries to stop between incomprehensibility (too little detail) and boredom (too much). Her longer pieces slacken and drift, but at fifteen hundred words the line is taut. As one of her narrators says, “You can’t tell everyone the truth all the time, and you certainly can’t tell anyone the whole truth, ever, because it would take too long.” Even poets find her concentration bracing. Matthew Zapruder, a poet and editor who keeps Davis’s “Collected Stories” on his shelf and turns to it whenever he needs a jolt, says, “It almost feels like a challenge to poetry. She can do this, why can’t we?”
“By fiction now I just mean a construct that’s a little different from reality,” Davis told me. “One aspect of that is a narrative voice that’s a little artificial, not quite my own.” As a person, Davis is tactful if particular; the speakers of her stories tend to be grand and hysterical, flies in bottles, frustrated by obstacles they can’t see. The woman who goes over and over a sequence of events, trying to establish whether her lover is being unfaithful; the man who calculates the cost per hour of a ten-day affair. (Those two examples come from “Break It Down,” her first full-length book, published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1986. That author photo—her frank gaze—gave rise to at least one come-on letter.) “The narrators are overthinking, and the overthinking tends to be funny, but the overthinking tends to be rooted in strong feeling,” Lorin Stein, who worked with her on two later books at FSG and is now the editor of The Paris Review, says. “You have the sense of characters who have a strong motivation to do something absurd and unproductive.”
“I see people sometimes who remind me of my narrators,” Davis said. “I’ll see a kind of mousy, earnest person at a reading, a woman with limp, long, dark hair, kind of very woebegone and sincere.” Some of her narrators, she thinks, are desperate to be understood. “That’s why they go into too much detail,” she said. “ ‘In case you didn’t quite get it, let me explain further.’ ”
When Davis was younger, the obsessions of her narrators tended to be amorous; now they are philosophical. “The Two Davises and the Rug,” in the new collection, is the story of two people named Davis, who “were not married to each other and they were not related by blood.” They are kindred nonetheless: “They were both indecisive people, or rather, they could be very decisive about some things, important things, or things to do with their work, but they could be very indecisive about smaller things, and change their minds from one day to the next, over and over again, being completely decided in favor of something one day and then completely decided against the same thing the next day.”
In the story, “this Davis” decides to sell a red-white-and-black wool rug at a yard sale to benefit a good cause. The rug has been lying in her son’s room, but her son doesn’t live at home anymore. At the yard sale, “the other Davis” considers buying it but doesn’t. By the time he has decided that he wants the rug, this Davis has decided to keep it. For the next twelve hundred words, this Davis worries extravagantly: should she, who had not really valued the rug until someone else desired it, keep it, or should she let the other Davis, whose house is “clean and tidy and thoughtfully arranged,” have it? Which one of them deserves it?
Davis did the same thing with a rug a few years ago, after Theo, her son with Cote, went away to college. “With that story, I’m not leaving out anything relevant,” she says. “But the obsessive quality is exaggerated. A lot is true, the ins and outs of reasoning, but a lot of normal life went on the same. In the story, you get the impression that the rug was the only thing happening. In real life, it’s just one strand. It’s, O.K., let’s see what happens if this rug and this dilemma becomes everything.”
For a contemplative, Davis is remarkably social. When Daniel was a baby, she joined a softball team; later, when Theo was young, she took a line-dancing class. She escapes herself, and the house, given half an opportunity—to collect stories for an oral history of the village, to sit on a town zoning board. “I don’t go into it thinking I need material,” she says. “I follow my interests pretty—I don’t like the word ‘intuitively.’ I follow them in a kind of natural way, without questioning them too much. Alan tries to be the brake on my impulses.”
Cote’s reservations have not stopped Davis from running for a seat on the governing board of her village. One snowy Saturday morning in late January, she had plans to go door to door collecting signatures with “the other Davis,” whose name is Bill, and who was running for reëlection. For her nominating petition, she needed signatures from five per cent of the previous election’s voters, which amounted to two or three people. (The village has a population of five hundred and seventy-one.) The mayor told her they didn’t really pay attention to Democrat or Republican, and suggested she make up her own affiliation, so she is running as a member of the Schoolhouse Party. “I’m interested to see on a small scale how people get along or don’t get along,” she said.
The temperature was ten degrees. Davis got a clipboard and a notebook and put on her winter coat. She was excited. “But they’re all people you know,” Cote said. When Bill Davis arrived, they drove half a mile down the road, to Helen and John Mullaly’s house. John, once a teacher at Davis and Cote’s schoolhouse, had recently celebrated his ninety-first birthday. Helen, a former head nurse, was in her late eighties. The Davises stayed for more than an hour, listening to their stories, in an overheated dining room crowded with clocks and photographs and figurines. Twice, John showed them a picture, cut from a newspaper, of Davos, Switzerland, where he had been during the Second World War. “Cleared the summit, met the Pope, pushed back the Germans,” he said. When Helen mentioned that the house had been owned by a doctor, who kept a log which she had found in the attic, Lydia’s eyes shone. The different clocks ticked out of time.
Later, Davis said, “I’m kind of always working, in a sense. Sitting and talking to my neighbors, I’m not really working, but I’m always sort of alert to things.” Two things had struck her particularly: the objects in the dining room, and Helen’s remark, as they left, that she loved driving in snowstorms the way some people love skiing—the opposite of a cliché about an old lady. (Davis, unexpectedly, plays tin whistle and Ping-Pong, and several years ago publicly sang scenes from “The Magic Flute” dressed as a witch, in a cast made up mostly of teen-agers.) “I’m not bored,” Davis said. “I don’t like the high-powered literary life. I’d rather sit and listen to Helen and John and their stories than be at a cocktail party in New York.”
On their rounds, the two Davises had stopped in at Bill’s place, a white clapboard house with a single dormer window. “See how clean and nice it is?” Lydia said, entering a dining room with an open fireplace and a Shaker rake on the wall. Susan Shapiro, Bill’s wife, was inside. Naturally, the rug came up for discussion. “Where would it have gone?” Lydia asked. “We had picked out a spot in Mark’s room,” Bill said. “Now I feel guilty!” she said. The rug was still upstairs in her house, in Theo’s rarely used bedroom.
Both Davises asked Shapiro for her signature. Shapiro looked at them wryly and said, “The Two Davises and the Village Board.”
Evasion is the shadow side of overwrought explanation: dwelling on minutiae can mask a problem of unspeakable magnitude. In “Letter to a Funeral Parlor,” when Davis objects to the company’s use of the portmanteau word “cremains” in reference to her father—before his death, the company had called him her “loved one”—distress over vocabulary stands in for mortal rage. What is left out gives the shape to what remains. Fictionalizing real events, Davis says, has to do with the selection of material, in the way of a teen-ager recounting to her mother how an evening was spent: “We went over to Joan’s house and hung out and listened to music, and then we went to McDonald’s.” Not the part about the vodka in the orange juice, not the part about the making out. Not a lie, just a different story.
For the most part, Davis leaves her children out of it. They represent a grammar problem in “A Double Negative”: “At a certain point in her life, she realizes it is not so much that she wants to have a child as that she does not want not to have a child, or not to have had a child.” In “Selfish,” which Davis calls “a tongue-in-cheek monologue about parenting that’s less painful,” her children, unnamed and featureless, are faint but pervasive, stubborn as ghosts. “The useful thing about being a selfish person is that when your children get hurt you don’t mind so much because you yourself are all right,” she writes. Difficulty arises from not being quite selfish enough:
[cartoon id="a18077"]
If you are just a little selfish, you take some trouble over them, you pay some attention to them, they have clean clothes most of the time, a fresh haircut fairly often, though not all the supplies they need for school, or not when they need them; you enjoy them, you laugh at their jokes, though you have little patience when they are naughty, they annoy you when you have work to do, and when they are very naughty you become very angry; you understand some of what they should have, in their lives, you know some of what they are doing, with their friends, you ask questions, though not very many, and not beyond a certain point, because there is so little time; then the trouble begins and you don’t notice signs of it because you are so busy; they steal, and you wonder how that thing came into the house; they show you what they have stolen, and when you ask questions, they lie; when they lie, you believe them, every time, because they seem so candid and it would take so long to find out the truth.
Incomplete selfishness, like a vaccination that doesn’t take, cannot protect against suffering. The only foolproof approach is to be totally selfish, to the point of being “privately relieved, glad, even delighted, that it isn’t happening to you.” In an e-mail, Davis wrote to me, “The narrator takes a pose. Or I take a pose through a confident narrator—in the beginning. Then—as so often happens in actual conversation—once one begins discussing a situation in detail, reliving it, one’s emotions change, one’s relation to the material changes. And that’s what happens in the story. When the narrator goes into detail, about the stealing and the lying, then she loses some of that confidence. She ends up pushing the difficult material away, saying, Don’t let it get near me.”
That story, with its shifting sense of culpability, is the closest Davis comes to describing her struggles with Daniel. As a teen-ager, he started going to clubs in New York City and became deeply involved with drugs. In 1996, when he was eighteen, he was present in the apartment when a dealer named Andre Melendez was murdered by Michael Alig, a former club promoter, and his roommate, Robert Riggs. Auster was given three thousand dollars of Melendez’s money in exchange for his silence, and later pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property and served a five-year probation. A decade ago, Hustvedt published a best-selling novel, “What I Loved,” which reimagines the events with all the obliquity of an episode of “Law & Order.” The story features a troubled boy whose mother, a poet, produces work that is “scrupulous, concise, and invested with the comedy inherent in distance.” Hustvedt describes the poet herself as “all boarded up and shut down like a condemned house.”
Lifting from life, Davis is cautious. She tends to ask her friends for permission before including them in stories. “I don’t really want to offend people, so I try to avoid it,” she said. “It’s a shock to see yourself depicted in someone’s writing, even if it’s not particularly negative. It’s a matter of being taken away and used.” Her mechanisms can be subtle, though—a change of gender, or of name, or less. Mitch Sisskind recalled being in a bookstore, leafing through a literary journal. “I started reading this story and saw that one of the characters was me, by name,” he said. “I thought I was losing my mind. I’ve never known anyone else that did that. I was flattered, but I was surprised.” She had referred to him as Mitchell, which no one does, thinking that it would disguise his identity.
A few years ago, when Harper’s was preparing to publish “Varieties of Disturbance,” a story about Davis’s mother, who was then still alive, Davis asked Daniel’s advice. (He lives in Florida and works at a performance space.) He suggested a small cut to spare his grandmother’s feelings. When the piece was collected in a book of the same name (a finalist for the National Book Award), she had died, and Davis restored the damning phrase, also at his suggestion.
“Hurting children is where I would draw the line,” Davis told me one evening, sitting in the kitchen with Cote. “A husband—you can hurt a husband. He does have to O.K. everything.” She turned to Cote. “You veto. But of course it’s not really fair to him, because then he’s called on to be gentlemanly.”
“There’s certain private stuff I don’t think is relevant,” Cote said.
“You’ve put up with it.”
“I was generous.”
“He’d have to think it’s a good piece of writing,” she said. “But the children are off limits.”
In her twenties, in Paris, Davis got about two-thirds of the way through “Swann’s Way,” in French, carefully writing down vocabulary and making notes. For the next thirty years, she earned a living mostly through translating. In a talk on the subject, she described her body of work as “books of all degrees of excellence and non-excellence, of interest and no interest . . . including a sentimental biography of Marie Curie, various histories of Chinese politics, art catalogues, the strange novels of Pierre Jean Jouve, a volume of travel essays by Michel Butor, and several books of fiction and literary philosophy by Maurice Blanchot.”
In 1997, Davis agreed to translate “Swann’s Way” for a new edition of “In Search of Lost Time.” She had never read the version by C. K. Scott Moncrieff, whose enhanced Edwardian style may be the reason most readers in English flag after a volume or two, and she didn’t read it then. She started working through the French, page by page, not skipping ahead to see what came next. “Just the way I wouldn’t write anything, even an e-mail, if it wasn’t decently written, the translation has to be good right away,” she told me. “I write it quickly but well, so that some of the time I would feel like a sieve or funnel, or maybe ‘pipeline’ is a better word.”
When she finished her draft, she looked carefully at the previous translations, particularly Scott Moncrieff’s. “Proust is plainer in his language and more straightforward and in a way more contemporary than the translation,” she says. “My aim was to stay very close.” The response to what one critic called Davis’s “sans-serif version,” published in 2003, was reserved: some reviewers felt that her accuracy—which kept intact word order and punctuation, and often preferred an obscure cognate to a flashier English rendering—came at the expense of felicity. The Times, however, praised her “fine rigor and exactitude.”
The book’s success is as important to Davis as that of any of her fictions. “I’m more jealous, almost, of my translations,” she says. “I really want my Proust to take the place of the Scott Moncrieff, because I think it’s closer.”
Davis’s downstairs office has rose-pink floor-length curtains, a space heater, and a cat. Small shelves are filled with books—“Studies in Lowland Scots,” “Famous Dogs in Fiction”—relevant to “Bob, Son of Battle,” a children’s book, published in 1898, that she read as a child and is now “translating” from tricky Victorian English into language a present-day Brearley girl could manage. Her desk is two file cabinets with a board laid across the top. Above it, on a bulletin board, is a homemade family tree that traces her connections to an ancestor whose description of life in a nineteenth-century New England village she has fashioned into verse. A photocopied page from an old notebook serves as another kind of genealogy, some two hundred years’ worth of fiction writers, from Swift to Hemingway. “I found it and thought, Well, that’s worth looking at every now and again,” she said. “I don’t really have the picture in my head. I probably did it when I was quite young. I was always trying to learn and remember.”
It is not only the act of writing that forces Davis to write fiction; reading is a danger, too. “I don’t need to go to other writers to get excited,” she says. “The problem is almost the opposite. Certain kinds of writing will give me too many ideas. I have to keep stopping and reacting.” She recently got a collection of lectures Roland Barthes gave at the Sorbonne. “I found that there were so many interesting ideas in one paragraph that I almost couldn’t read it.”
E-mail can be equally threatening. In the office, Davis opened up her account to a folder of messages from the Listserv at Bard College, where she used to teach occasionally and where Cote was on the faculty for three decades. Material, practically ready-made. Here was a message from a woman named Lisa Hedges, wondering if anyone had seen her glasses. “I loved her name,” Davis said. “This is what it started as: ‘Round, faux tortoiseshell glasses, bifocal lenses, lost sometime Friday, between the Nursery School, B Village, A Sacred Space. It would be great if somebody has found them and they aren’t in a place covered in a foot of snow!’ ”
What it became:
Personal Announcement
Woman named Shrubbs
Has lost faux tortoiseshell eyeglasses
Where?
Somewhere between nursery school
and sacred space
They are possibly
covered by snow.
“This is very vestigial,” Davis said. “Or maybe it isn’t, I don’t know. I kind of like it the way it is.” Sometimes the longer something sits, the more finished it seems. A little while later, she said, “When you’re spying, when you’re looking, when you’re on the alert for a story, part of it is seeing the thing in isolation, apart from the normalizing context.”
Found objects emerge frequently as source and as finished work. (“An Example of the Continuing Past Tense in a Hotel Room”: “Your housekeeper has been Shelly.”) Davis sees this repurposing as thrift. She says, “My grandmother, my mother, and me—we were always making do and saving, very economical. I like the idea that the writing would belong to that practical tradition.”
Even now, much of Davis’s writing has its first life in obscure literary magazines. All the editors have to do is ask. If she likes the cover letter, and feels she can trust them, she’ll send work. In small magazines she feels free to experiment. “There’s an opposition between what’s good for my career and what’s good for my writing,” she said, walking back into the kitchen, where Cote was waiting for his lunch. “What’s good for my writing is these little places.”
“You’re building your fan base,” Cote said.
“I don’t think I’d ever think of it as ‘building my fan base.’ I would never sit back and do that intentionally.”
“Then they go on YouTube and start talking about it,” Cote said.
“I really like being read by young people,” Davis said. “I love it that friends of my son Theo, who is twenty-five, will say, ‘Is your mother Lydia Davis? I love her work. ’ ”
In 2001, Davis published a book with McSweeney’s, after Dave Eggers wrote her a fan letter. New, young readers found in her work an idiosyncratic approach to the problem of storytelling, something handmade or unmade, each story like a cool thing from an old junk shop. The title piece—“Samuel Johnson Is Indignant:”—was one line long: “that Scotland has so few trees.” (Humor, language, emotion.) “That’s such a radical act and so liberating to put that on a page and call it finished,” Eggers told me. “For those of us who are attracted to people who make room for new ways of defining a short story or who defy categorization at all, she was a real hero.”
By the time FSG published her “Collected,” in 2009, American fiction had more fully accommodated itself to the insubstantial. Everything is too hard to understand until it isn’t. For the first time, Davis’s writing was acknowledged as belonging to an American tradition. Jonathan Galassi, the president and publisher of FSG, says, “People caught up with her.”
“I have to guard against the tendency—I could make anything into a story,” Davis told me. Several years ago, she started writing a long note to her literary executor, but had to stop when it began to take on a life of its own. “I was trying just to write instructions, you know, ‘My notebooks should go here,’ ‘You should look through my notebooks and make sure to take out any references to blah blah blah,’ ” she said. “But it began to get too elaborate, too detailed, too opinionated, and too irrational. It wasn’t a straightforward document any more. I didn’t really want it to be a story, because I needed it to be an actual letter to my executor.” She could not pull it back into real life, though, and for the time being the letter is stopped midstream. ♦

1. Write down the numeric value corresponding to the first band on the left.
2. Write down the numeric value corresponding to the second band from the left.
3. Write down the number of zeros indicated by the multiplier band, which represents a power of 10
(black = no extra zeros, brown = 1 zero, etc.). A gold multiplier band indicates that the decimal
is shifted one place to the left; a silver multiplier band indicates that the decimal is shifted
two places to the left.
4. The tolerance band represents the precision. So, for example, we would not be surprised to find a 100
5 percent tolerance resistor that measures anywhere in the range of 95 to 105 .

Pi, Sigma Xi, Sigma Delta Chi, Fellow of IEEE, ASEE, and NAEB. While
at Purdue, he received numerous teaching awards, including the univer-
sity’s Best Teacher Award. He is also listed in Purdue’s Book of Great
Teachers, a permanent wall display in the Purdue Memorial Union, dedi-
cated on April 23, 1999. The book bears the names of the inaugural group
of 225 faculty members, past and present, who have devoted their lives to
excellence in teaching and scholarship. They were chosen by their students
and their peers as Purdue’s finest educators.
JACK E. KEMMERLY received his B.S. magna cum laude from The Catholic
University of America, M.S. from University of Denver, and Ph.D. from
Purdue University. Professor Kemmerly first taught at Purdue University
and later worked as principal engineer at the Aeronutronic Division of Ford
Motor Company. He then joined California State University, Fullerton,
where he served as Professor, Chairman of the Faculty of Electrical Engi-
neering, Chairman of the Engineering Division, and Professor Emeritus.
Professor Kemmerly’s professional society memberships included Eta
Kappa Nu, Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, ASEE, and IEEE (Senior Member). His
pursuits outside of academe included being an officer in the Little League
and a scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts.
STEVEN M. DURBIN received the B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical
Engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana. Subsequently, he
was with the Department of Electrical Engineering at Florida State University
and Florida A&M University before joining the University of Canterbury, New
Zealand, in 2000. SinceAugust 2010, he has been with the University at Buffalo,
The State University of New York, where he holds a joint appointment between
the Departments of Electrical Engineering and Physics. His teaching interests
include circuits, electronics, electromagnetics, solid-state electronics and
nanotechnology. His research interests are primarily concerned with the
development of new semiconductor materials—in particular those based on ox-
ide and nitride compounds—as well as novel optoelectronic device structures.

T
he target audience colors everything about a book, being a major fac-
tor in decisions big and small, particularly both the pace and the
overall writing style. Consequently it is important to note that the au-
thors have made the conscious decision to write this book to the student,
and not to the instructor. Our underlying philosophy is that reading the book
should be enjoyable, despite the level of technical detail that it must incor-
porate. When we look back to the very first edition of Engineering Circuit
Analysis, it’s clear that it was developed specifically to be more of a con-
versation than a dry, dull discourse on a prescribed set of fundamental top-
ics. To keep it conversational, we’ve had to work hard at updating the book
so that it continues to speak to the increasingly diverse group of students
using it all over the world.
Although in many engineering programs the introductory circuits course
is preceded or accompanied by an introductory physics course in which
electricity and magnetism are introduced (typically from a fields perspec-
tive), this is not required to use this book. After finishing the course, many
students find themselves truly amazed that such a broad set of analytical
tools have been derived from only three simple scientific laws—Ohm’s
law and Kirchhoff’s voltage and current laws. The first six chapters assume
only a familiarity with algebra and simultaneous equations; subsequent
chapters assume a first course in calculus (derivatives and integrals) is being
taken in tandem. Beyond that, we have tried to incorporate sufficient details
to allow the book to be read on its own.
So, what key features have been designed into this book with the student
in mind? First, individual chapters are organized into relatively short sub-
sections, each having a single primary topic. The language has been up-
dated to remain informal and to flow smoothly. Color is used to highlight
important information as opposed to merely improve the aesthetics of the
page layout, and white space is provided for jotting down short notes and
questions. New terms are defined as they are introduced, and examples are
placed strategically to demonstrate not only basic concepts, but problem-
solving approaches as well. Practice problems relevant to the examples are
placed in proximity so that students can try out the techniques for them-
selves before attempting the end-of-chapter exercises. The exercises repre-
sent a broad range of difficulties, generally ordered from simpler to more
complex, and grouped according to the relevant section of each chapter.
Answers to selected odd-numbered end-of-chapter exercises are posted on
the book’s website at www.mhhe.com/haytdurbin8e.
Engineering is an intensive subject to study, and students often find them-
selves faced with deadlines and serious workloads. This does not mean that
textbooks have to be dry and pompous, however, or that coursework should
never contain any element of fun. In fact, successfully solving a problem of-
ten is fun, and learning how to do that can be fun as well. Determining how
xvxvi
PREFACE
to best accomplish this within the context of a textbook is an ongoing
process. The authors have always relied on the often very candid feedback
received from our own students at Purdue University; the California State
University, Fullerton; Fort Lewis College in Durango, the joint engineering
program at Florida A&M University and Florida State University, the Uni-
versity of Canterbury (New Zealand) and the University at Buffalo. We also
rely on comments, corrections, and suggestions from instructors and students
worldwide, and for this edition, consideration has been given to a new source
of comments, namely, semianonymous postings on various websites.
The first edition of Engineering Circuit Analysis was written by Bill
Hayt and Jack Kemmerly, two engineering professors who very much en-
joyed teaching, interacting with their students, and training generations of
future engineers. It was well received due to its compact structure, “to the
point” informal writing style, and logical organization. There is no timidity
when it comes to presenting the theory underlying a specific topic, or
pulling punches when developing mathematical expressions. Everything,
however, was carefully designed to assist students in their learning, present
things in a straightforward fashion, and leave theory for theory’s sake to
other books. They clearly put a great deal of thought into writing the book,
and their enthusiasm for the subject comes across to the reader.
KEY FEATURES OF THE EIGHTH EDITION
•
We have taken great care to retain key features from the seventh edition
which were clearly working well. These include the general layout and se-
quence of chapters, the basic style of both the text and line drawings, the use
of four-color printing where appropriate, numerous worked examples and
related practice problems, and grouping of end-of-chapter exercises accord-
ing to section. Transformers continue to merit their own chapter, and com-
plex frequency is briefly introduced through a student-friendly extension of
the phasor technique, instead of indirectly by merely stating the Laplace
transform integral. We also have retained the use of icons, an idea first in-
troduced in the sixth edition:
Provides a heads-up to common mistakes;
Indicates a point that’s worth noting;
Denotes a design problem to which there is no unique answer;
Indicates a problem which requires computer-aided analysis.
The introduction of engineering-oriented analysis and design software in
the book has been done with the mind-set that it should assist, not replace,
the learning process. Consequently, the computer icon denotes problems
that are typically phrased such that the software is used to verify answers,
and not simply provide them. Both MATLAB ® and PSpice ® are used in this
context.PREFACE

Over 1000 new and revised end-of-chapter exercises
A new overarching philosophy on end-of-chapter exercises, with each
section containing problems similar to those solved in worked
examples and practice problems, before proceeding to more complex
problems to test the reader’s skills
Introduction of Chapter-Integrating Exercises at the end of each
chapter. For the convenience of instructors and students, end-of-
chapter exercises are grouped by section. To provide the opportunity
for assigning exercises with less emphasis on an explicit solution
method (for example, mesh or nodal analysis), as well as to give a
broader perspective on key topics within each chapter, a select number
of Chapter-Integrating Exercises appear at the end of each chapter.
New photos, many in full color, to provide connection to the real world
Updated screen captures and text descriptions of computer-aided
analysis software
New worked examples and practice problems
Updates to the Practical Application feature, introduced to help
students connect material in each chapter to broader concepts in
engineering. Topics include distortion in amplifiers, modeling
automotive suspension systems, practical aspects of grounding, the
relationship of poles to stability, resistivity, and the memristor,
sometimes called “the missing element”
Streamlining of text, especially in the worked examples, to get to the
point faster

I joined the book in 1999, and sadly never had the opportunity to speak
to either Bill or Jack about the revision process, although I count myself
lucky to have taken a circuits course from Bill Hayt while I was a student at
Purdue. It is a distinct privilege to serve as a coauthor to Engineering
Circuit Analysis, and in working on this book I give its fundamental philos-
ophy and target audience the highest priority. I greatly appreciate the many
people who have already provided feedback—both positive and negative—
on aspects of previous editions, and welcome others to do so as well, either
through the publishers (McGraw-Hill Higher Education) or to me directly
(durbin@ieee.org).
Of course, this project has been a team effort, as is the case with every
modern textbook. In particular I would like to thank Raghu Srinivasan

Introduction
KEY CONCEPTS
PREAMBLE
Although there are clear specialties within the field of engineering,
all engineers share a considerable amount of common ground,
particularly when it comes to problem solving. In fact, many prac-
ticing engineers find it is possible to work in a large variety of
settings and even outside their traditional specialty, as their skill set
is often transferrable to other environments. Today’s engineering
graduates are employed in a broad range of jobs, from design of
individual components and systems, to assisting in solving socio-
economic problems such as air and water pollution, urban planning,
communication, mass transportation, power generation and distribu-
tion, and efficient use and conservation of natural resources.
Circuit analysis has long been a traditional introduction to the
art of problem solving from an engineering perspective, even for
those whose interests lie outside electrical engineering. There are
many reasons for this, but one of the best is that in today’s world
it’s extremely unlikely for any engineer to encounter a system that
does not in some way include electrical circuitry. As circuits be-
come smaller and require less power, and power sources become
smaller and cheaper, embedded circuits are seemingly everywhere.
Since most engineering situations require a team effort at some
stage, having a working knowledge of circuit analysis therefore
helps to provide everyone on a project with the background needed
for effective communication.
Consequently, this book is not just about “circuit analysis” from
an engineering perspective, but is also about developing basic
problem-solving skills as they apply to situations an engineer is
likely to encounter. As part of this, we also find that we’re develop-
ing an intuitive understanding at a general level, and often we can

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Not all electrical engineers routinely make use of circuit
analysis, but they often bring to bear analytical and
problem-solving skills learned early on in their careers.
A circuit analysis course is one of the first exposures to
such concepts. (Solar Mirrors: © Corbis; Skyline: © Getty

understand a complex system by its analogy to an electrical circuit. Before
launching into all this, however, we’ll begin with a quick preview of the
topics found in the remainder of the book, pausing briefly to ponder the
difference between analysis and design, and the evolving role computer
tools play in modern engineering.

OVERVIEW OF TEXT
The fundamental subject of this text is linear circuit analysis, which some-
times prompts a few readers to ask,
“Is there ever any nonlinear circuit analysis?”
Sure! We encounter nonlinear circuits every day: they capture and decode
signals for our TVs and radios, perform calculations millions of times a
second inside microprocessors, convert speech into electrical signals for
transmission over phone lines, and execute many other functions outside
our field of view. In designing, testing, and implementing such nonlinear
circuits, detailed analysis is unavoidable.
“Then why study linear circuit analysis?”
Television sets include many nonlinear circuits. A great
deal of them, however, can be understood and analyzed
with the assistance of linear models. (© Sony Electronics,
Inc.)
you might ask. An excellent question. The simple fact of the matter is that
no physical system (including electrical circuits) is ever perfectly linear.
Fortunately for us, however, a great many systems behave in a reasonablySECTION 1.1 OVERVIEW OF TEXT
linear fashion over a limited range—allowing us to model them as linear
systems if we keep the range limitations in mind.
For example, consider the common function
f (x) = e x
A linear approximation to this function is
f (x) ≈ 1 + x
Let’s test this out. Table 1.1 shows both the exact value and the approx-
imate value of f (x) for a range of x. Interestingly, the linear approximation
is exceptionally accurate up to about x = 0.1, when the relative error is still
less than 1%. Although many engineers are rather quick on a calculator, it’s
hard to argue that any approach is faster than just adding 1.

Linear problems are inherently more easily solved than their nonlinear
counterparts. For this reason, we often seek reasonably accurate linear ap-
proximations (or models) to physical situations. Furthermore, the linear
models are more easily manipulated and understood—making design a
more straightforward process.
The circuits we will encounter in subsequent chapters all represent linear
approximations to physical electric circuits. Where appropriate, brief discus-
sions of potential inaccuracies or limitations to these models are provided, but
generally speaking we find them to be suitably accurate for most applications.
When greater accuracy is required in practice, nonlinear models are em-
ployed, but with a considerable increase in solution complexity. A detailed dis-
cussion of what constitutes a linear electric circuit can be found in Chap. 2.
Linear circuit analysis can be separated into four broad categories: (1)
dc analysis, where the energy sources do not change with time; (2) transient
analysis, where things often change quickly; (3) sinusoidal analysis, which
applies to both ac power and signals; and (4) frequency response, which is
the most general of the four categories, but typically assumes something is
changing with time. We begin our journey with the topic of resistive cir-
cuits, which may include simple examples such as a flashlight or a toaster.
This provides us with a perfect opportunity to learn a number of very pow-
erful engineering circuit analysis techniques, such as nodal analysis, mesh
analysis, superposition, source transformation, Thévenin’s theorem, Norton’s

theorem, and several methods for simplifying networks of components con-
nected in series or parallel. The single most redeeming feature of resistive
circuits is that the time dependence of any quantity of interest does not
affect our analysis procedure. In other words, if asked for an electrical quan-
tity of a resistive circuit at several specific instants in time, we do not need
to analyze the circuit more than once. As a result, we will spend most of our
effort early on considering only dc circuits—those circuits whose electrical
parameters do not vary with time.
Although dc circuits such as flashlights or automotive rear window de-
foggers are undeniably important in everyday life, things are often much
more interesting when something happens suddenly. In circuit analysis
parlance, we refer to transient analysis as the suite of techniques used to
study circuits which are suddenly energized or de-energized. To make such
circuits interesting, we need to add elements that respond to the rate of
change of electrical quantities, leading to circuit equations which include
derivatives and integrals. Fortunately, we can obtain such equations using
the simple techniques learned in the first part of our study.
Still, not all time-varying circuits are turned on and off suddenly. Air
conditioners, fans, and fluorescent lights are only a few of the many exam-
ples we may see daily. In such situations, a calculus-based approach for
every analysis can become tedious and time-consuming. Fortunately, there
is a better alternative for situations where equipment has been allowed
to run long enough for transient effects to die out, and this is commonly
referred to as ac or sinusoidal analysis, or sometimes phasor analysis.
The final leg of our journey deals with a subject known as frequency
response. Working directly with the differential equations obtained in time-
domain analysis helps us develop an intuitive understanding of the opera-
tion of circuits containing energy storage elements (e.g., capacitors and
inductors). As we shall see, however, circuits with even a relatively small
number of components can be somewhat onerous to analyze, and so much
more straightforward methods have been developed. These methods, which
include Laplace and Fourier analysis, allow us to transform differential
equations into algebraic equations. Such methods also enable us to design
circuits to respond in specific ways to particular frequencies. We make use
of frequency-dependent circuits every day when we dial a telephone, select
our favorite radio station, or connect to the Internet.

RELATIONSHIP OF CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
TO ENGINEERING
Whether we intend to pursue further circuit analysis at the completion of
this course or not, it is worth noting that there are several layers to the con-
cepts under study. Beyond the nuts and bolts of circuit analysis techniques
lies the opportunity to develop a methodical approach to problem solving,
the ability to determine the goal or goals of a particular problem, skill at
collecting the information needed to effect a solution, and, perhaps equally
importantly, opportunities for practice at verifying solution accuracy.
Students familiar with the study of other engineering topics such as fluid
flow, automotive suspension systems, bridge design, supply chain manage-
ment, or process control will recognize the general form of many of the5

equations we develop to describe the behavior of various circuits. We simply
need to learn how to “translate” the relevant variables (for example, replacing
voltage with force, charge with distance, resistance with friction coefficient
etc.) to find that we already know how to work a new type of problem. Very
often, if we have previous experience in solving a similar or related problem,
our intuition can guide us through the solution of a totally new problem.
What we are about to learn regarding linear circuit analysis forms the
basis for many subsequent electrical engineering courses. The study of elec-
tronics relies on the analysis of circuits with devices known as diodes and
transistors, which are used to construct power supplies, amplifiers, and dig-
ital circuits. The skills which we will develop are typically applied in a
rapid, methodical fashion by electronics engineers, who sometimes can
analyze a complicated circuit without even reaching for a pencil! The
time-domain and frequency-domain chapters of this text lead directly into
discussions of signal processing, power transmission, control theory, and
communications. We find that frequency-domain analysis in particular is
an extremely powerful technique, easily applied to any physical system
subjected to time-varying excitation, and particularly helpful in the design
of filters.

ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
Engineers take a fundamental understanding of scientific principles, com-
bine this with practical knowledge often expressed in mathematical terms,
and (frequently with considerable creativity) arrive at a solution to a given
problem. Analysis is the process through which we determine the scope of
a problem, obtain the information required to understand it, and compute
the parameters of interest. Design is the process by which we synthesize
something new as part of the solution to a problem. Generally speaking,
there is an expectation that a problem requiring design will have no unique
solution, whereas the analysis phase typically will. Thus, the last step in
designing is always analyzing the result to see if it meets specifications.

system can be modeled using linear circuit elements to

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
This text is focused on developing our ability to analyze and solve
problems because it is the starting point in every engineering situation. The
philosophy of this book is that we need clear explanations, well-placed ex-
amples, and plenty of practice to develop such an ability. Therefore, elements
of design are integrated into end-of-chapter problems and later chapters so as
to be enjoyable rather than distracting.

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
Solving the types of equations that result from circuit analysis can often be-
come notably cumbersome for even moderately complex circuits. This of
course introduces an increased probability that errors will be made, in addi-
tion to considerable time in performing the calculations. The desire to find
a tool to help with this process actually predates electronic computers, with
purely mechanical computers such as the Analytical Engine designed by
Charles Babbage in the 1880s proposed as possible solutions. Perhaps the
earliest successful electronic computer designed for solution of differential
equations was the 1940s-era ENIAC, whose vacuum tubes filled a large
room. With the advent of low-cost desktop computers, however, computer-
aided circuit analysis has developed into an invaluable everyday tool which
has become an integral part of not only analysis but design as well.
One of the most powerful aspects of computer-aided design is the rela-
tively recent integration of multiple programs in a fashion transparent to the
user. This allows the circuit to be drawn schematically on the screen, re-
duced automatically to the format required by an analysis program (such as
SPICE, introduced in Chap. 4), and the resulting output smoothly trans-
ferred to a third program capable of plotting various electrical quantities ofSECTION 1.5 SUCCESSFUL PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES

interest that describe the operation of the circuit. Once the engineer is satis-
fied with the simulated performance of the design, the same software can
generate the printed circuit board layout using geometrical parameters in
the components library. This level of integration is continually increasing,
to the point where soon an engineer will be able to draw a schematic, click
a few buttons, and walk to the other side of the table to pick up a manufac-
tured version of the circuit, ready to test!
The reader should be wary, however, of one thing. Circuit analysis soft-
ware, although fun to use, is by no means a replacement for good old-
fashioned paper-and-pencil analysis. We need to have a solid understanding of
how circuits work in order to develop an ability to design them. Simply going
through the motions of running a particular software package is a little like
playing the lottery: with user-generated entry errors, hidden default parame-
ters in the myriad of menu choices, and the occasional shortcoming of human-
written code, there is no substitute for having at least an approximate idea of
the expected behavior of a circuit. Then, if the simulation result does not agree
with expectations, we can find the error early, rather than after it’s too late.
Still, computer-aided analysis is a powerful tool. It allows us to vary pa-
rameter values and evaluate the change in circuit performance, and to con-
sider several variations to a design in a straightforward manner. The result
is a reduction of repetitive tasks, and more time to concentrate on engineer-
ing details.

SUCCESSFUL PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES
As the reader might have picked up, this book is just as much about problem
solving as it is about circuit analysis. As a result, the expectation is that during
your time as an engineering student, you are learning how to solve problems—
so just at this moment, those skills are not yet fully developed. As you proceed

through your course of study, you will pick up techniques that work for you,
and likely continue to do so as a practicing engineer. At this stage, then, we
should spend a few moments discussing some basic points.
The first point is that by far, the most common difficulty encountered by
engineering students is not knowing how to start a problem. This improves
with experience, but early on that’s of no help. The best advice we can give
is to adopt a methodical approach, beginning with reading the problem
statement slowly and carefully (and more than once, if needed). Since
experience usually gives us some type of insight into how to deal with a
specific problem, worked examples appear throughout the book. Rather
than just read them, however, it might be helpful to work through them with
a pencil and a piece of paper.
Once we’ve read through the problem, and feel we might have some use-
ful experience, the next step is to identify the goal of the problem—perhaps
to calculate a voltage or a power, or to select a component value. Knowing
where we’re going is a big help. The next step is to collect as much infor-
mation as we can, and to organize it somehow.
At this point we’re still not ready to reach for the calculator. It’s best
first to devise a plan, perhaps based on experience, perhaps based simply on
our intuition. Sometimes plans work, and sometimes they don’t. Starting
with our initial plan, it’s time to construct an initial set of equations. If they
appear complete, we can solve them. If not, we need to either locate more
information, modify our plan, or both.
Once we have what appears to be a working solution, we should not
stop, even if exhausted and ready for a break. No engineering problem is
solved unless the solution is tested somehow. We might do this by per-
forming a computer simulation, or solving the problem a different way, or
perhaps even just estimating what answer might be reasonable.
Since not everyone likes to read to learn, these steps are summarized in
the adjacent flowchart. This is just one particular problem-solving strategy,
and the reader of course should feel free to modify it as necessary. The real
key, however, is to try and learn in a relaxed, low-stress environment free of
distractions. Experience is the best teacher, and learning from our own mis-
takes will always be part of the process of becoming a skilled engineer.

INTRODUCTION
In conducting circuit analysis, we often find ourselves seeking spe-
cific currents, voltages, or powers, so here we begin with a brief de-
scription of these quantities. In terms of components that can be
used to build electrical circuits, we have quite a few from which to
choose. We initially focus on the resistor, a simple passive compo-
nent, and a range of idealized active sources of voltage and current.
As we move forward, new components will be added to the inven-
tory to allow more complex (and useful) circuits to be considered.
A quick word of advice before we begin: Pay close attention to
the role of “+” and “−” signs when labeling voltages, and the sig-
nificance of the arrow in defining current; they often make the
difference between wrong and right answers.

In order to state the value of some measurable quantity, we must
give both a number and a unit, such as “3 meters.” Fortunately, we
all use the same number system. This is not true for units, and a lit-
tle time must be spent in becoming familiar with a suitable system.
We must agree on a standard unit and be assured of its permanence
and its general acceptability. The standard unit of length, for exam-
ple, should not be defined in terms of the distance between two
marks on a certain rubber band; this is not permanent, and further-
more everybody else is using another standard.
The most frequently used system of units is the one adopted by
the National Bureau of Standards in 1964; it is used by all major
professional engineering societies and is the language in which to-
day’s textbooks are written. This is the International System of
Units (abbreviated SI in all languages), adopted by the General

CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. Modified several times
since, the SI is built upon seven basic units: the meter, kilogram, second,
ampere, kelvin, mole, and candela (see Table 2.1). This is a “metric system,”
some form of which is now in common use in most countries of the world,
although it is not yet widely used in the United States. Units for other quan-
tities such as volume, force, energy, etc., are derived from these seven base
units.
TABLE ● 2.1 SI Base Units
There is some inconsistency regarding whether units
named after a person should be capitalized. Here, we
will adopt the most contemporary convention, 1,2 where
such units are written out in lowercase (e.g., watt, joule),
but abbreviated with an uppercase symbol (e.g., W, J).

The fundamental unit of work or energy is the joule (J). One joule
(a kg m 2 s −2 in SI base units) is equivalent to 0.7376 foot pound-force
(ft · lbf). Other energy units include the calorie (cal), equal to 4.187 J;
the British thermal unit (Btu), which is 1055 J; and the kilowatthour (kWh),
equal to 3.6 × 10 6 J. Power is defined as the rate at which work is done
or energy is expended. The fundamental unit of power is the watt (W),
defined as 1 J/s. One watt is equivalent to 0.7376 ft · lbf/s or, equivalently,
1/745.7 horsepower (hp).
The SI uses the decimal system to relate larger and smaller units to the
basic unit, and employs prefixes to signify the various powers of 10. A list
of prefixes and their symbols is given in Table 2.2; the ones most commonly
encountered in engineering are highlighted.

SECTION 2.2 CHARGE, CURRENT, VOLTAGE, AND POWER
These prefixes are worth memorizing, for they will appear often both in
this text and in other technical work. Combinations of several prefixes, such
as the millimicrosecond, are unacceptable. It is worth noting that in terms
of distance, it is common to see “micron (μm)” as opposed to “microme-
ter,” and often the angstrom (Å) is used for 10 −10 meter. Also, in circuit
analysis and engineering in general, it is fairly common to see numbers ex-
pressed in what are frequently termed “engineering units.” In engineering
notation, a quantity is represented by a number between 1 and 999 and an
appropriate metric unit using a power divisible by 3. So, for example, it is
preferable to express the quantity 0.048 W as 48 mW, instead of 4.8 cW,
4.8 × 10 −2 W, or 48,000 μW.

CHARGE, CURRENT, VOLTAGE, AND POWER
Charge
One of the most fundamental concepts in electric circuit analysis is that of
charge conservation. We know from basic physics that there are two types
of charge: positive (corresponding to a proton) and negative (corresponding
to an electron). For the most part, this text is concerned with circuits in
which only electron flow is relevant. There are many devices (such as bat-
teries, diodes, and transistors) in which positive charge motion is important
to understanding internal operation, but external to the device we typically
concentrate on the electrons which flow through the connecting wires.
Although we continuously transfer charges between different parts of a cir-
cuit, we do nothing to change the total amount of charge. In other words, we
neither create nor destroy electrons (or protons) when running electric
circuits. 1 Charge in motion represents a current.
In the SI system, the fundamental unit of charge is the coulomb (C).
It is defined in terms of the ampere by counting the total charge that
passes through an arbitrary cross section of a wire during an interval of one
second; one coulomb is measured each second for a wire carrying a current
of 1 ampere (Fig. 2.1). In this system of units, a single electron has a charge
of −1.602 × 10 −19 C and a single proton has a charge of +1.602 × 10 −19 C.
(1) Although the occasional appearance of smoke may seem to suggest otherwise. . .
As seen in Table 2.1, the base units of the SI are not
derived from fundamental physical quantities. Instead,
they represent historically agreed upon measurements,
leading to definitions which occasionally seem
backward. For example, it would make more sense
physically to define the ampere based on electronic
charge.

CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
A quantity of charge that does not change with time is typically repre-
sented by Q. The instantaneous amount of charge (which may or may not be
time-invariant) is commonly represented by q(t), or simply q. This conven-
tion is used throughout the remainder of the text: capital letters are reserved
for constant (time-invariant) quantities, whereas lowercase letters represent
the more general case. Thus, a constant charge may be represented by either
Q or q, but an amount of charge that changes over time must be represented
by the lowercase letter q.

The unit of current is the ampere (A), named afterA. M.Ampère, a French
physicist. It is commonly abbreviated as an “amp,” although this is unofficial
and somewhat informal. One ampere equals 1 coulomb per second.
Using Eq. [1], we compute the instantaneous current and obtain Fig. 2.3.
The use of the lowercase letter i is again to be associated with an instantaneous
value; an uppercase I would denote a constant (i.e., time-invariant) quantity.
The charge transferred between time t 0 and t may be expressed as a
definite integral:

The total charge transferred over all time is thus given by

■ FIGURE 2.3 The instantaneous current i
where q is given in Fig. 2.2.
The idea of “transfer of charge” or “charge in motion” is of vital importance
to us in studying electric circuits because, in moving a charge from place to
place, we may also transfer energy from one point to another. The familiar
cross-country power-transmission line is a practical example of a device
that transfers energy. Of equal importance is the possibility of varying the
rate at which the charge is transferred in order to communicate or transfer
information. This process is the basis of communication systems such as
radio, television, and telemetry.
The current present in a discrete path, such as a metallic wire, has both a
numerical value and a direction associated with it; it is a measure of the rate
at which charge is moving past a given reference point in a specified direction.
Once we have specified a reference direction, we may then let q(t) be the
total charge that has passed the reference point since an arbitrary time t = 0,
moving in the defined direction. A contribution to this total charge will be
negative if negative charge is moving in the reference direction, or if posi-
tive charge is moving in the opposite direction. As an example, Fig. 2.2
shows a history of the total charge q(t) that has passed a given reference
point in a wire (such as the one shown in Fig. 2.1).
We define the current at a specific point and flowing in a specified direc-
tion as the instantaneous rate at which net positive charge is moving past
that point in the specified direction. This, unfortunately, is the historical de-
finition, which came into popular use before it was appreciated that current
in wires is actually due to negative, not positive, charge motion. Current is
symbolized by I or i, and so

SECTION 2.2 CHARGE, CURRENT, VOLTAGE, AND POWER
Several different types of current are illustrated in Fig. 2.4. A current
that is constant in time is termed a direct current, or simply dc, and is shown
by Fig. 2.4a. We will find many practical examples of currents that vary si-
nusoidally with time (Fig. 2.4b); currents of this form are present in normal
household circuits. Such a current is often referred to as alternating current,
or ac. Exponential currents and damped sinusoidal currents (Fig. 2.4c and d )
will also be encountered later.
We create a graphical symbol for current by placing an arrow next to the
conductor. Thus, in Fig. 2.5a the direction of the arrow and the value 3 A in-
dicate either that a net positive charge of 3 C/s is moving to the right or that a
net negative charge of −3 C/s is moving to the left each second. In Fig. 2.5b
there are again two possibilities: either −3 A is flowing to the left or +3 A is
flowing to the right. All four statements and both figures represent currents
that are equivalent in their electrical effects, and we say that they are equal.
A nonelectrical analogy that may be easier to visualize is to think in terms of
a personal savings account: e.g., a deposit can be viewed as either a negative
cash flow out of your account or a positive flow into your account.
It is convenient to think of current as the motion of positive charge, even
though it is known that current flow in metallic conductors results from
electron motion. In ionized gases, in electrolytic solutions, and in some
semiconductor materials, however, positive charges in motion consti-
tute part or all of the current. Thus, any definition of current can agree with
the physical nature of conduction only part of the time. The definition and
symbolism we have adopted are standard.
It is essential that we realize that the current arrow does not indicate the
“actual” direction of current flow but is simply part of a convention that
allows us to talk about “the current in the wire” in an unambiguous manner.
The arrow is a fundamental part of the definition of a current! Thus, to talk
about the value of a current i 1 (t) without specifying the arrow is to discuss
an undefined entity. For example, Fig. 2.6a and b are meaningless represen-
tations of i 1 (t), whereas Fig. 2.6c is complete.

We must now begin to refer to a circuit element, something best defined in
general terms to begin with. Such electrical devices as fuses, light bulbs, re-
sistors, batteries, capacitors, generators, and spark coils can be represented
by combinations of simple circuit elements. We begin by showing a very
general circuit element as a shapeless object possessing two terminals at
which connections to other elements may be made (Fig. 2.8).
There are two paths by which current may enter or leave the element. In
subsequent discussions we will define particular circuit elements by describ-
ing the electrical characteristics that may be observed at their terminals.
In Fig. 2.8, let us suppose that a dc current is sent into terminal A,
through the general element, and back out of terminal B. Let us also assume
that pushing charge through the element requires an expenditure of energy.
We then say that an electrical voltage (or a potential difference) exists be-
tween the two terminals, or that there is a voltage “across” the element.
Thus, the voltage across a terminal pair is a measure of the work required to
move charge through the element. The unit of voltage is the volt, 2 and 1 volt
is the same as 1 J/C. Voltage is represented by V or v.
Avoltage can exist between a pair of electrical terminals whether a current
is flowing or not. An automobile battery, for example, has a voltage of 12 V
across its terminals even if nothing whatsoever is connected to the terminals.
According to the principle of conservation of energy, the energy that is
expended in forcing charge through the element must appear somewhere
else. When we later meet specific circuit elements, we will note whether
that energy is stored in some form that is readily available as electric energy
or whether it changes irreversibly into heat, acoustic energy, or some other
nonelectrical form.
We must now establish a convention by which we can distinguish be-
tween energy supplied to an element and energy that is supplied by the
element itself. We do this by our choice of sign for the voltage of terminal
A with respect to terminal B. If a positive current is entering terminal A of
the element and an external source must expend energy to establish this cur-
rent, then terminal A is positive with respect to terminal B. (Alternatively,
we may say that terminal B is negative with respect to terminal A.)
The sense of the voltage is indicated by a plus-minus pair of algebraic
signs. In Fig. 2.9a, for example, the placement of the + sign at terminal A
indicates that terminal A is v volts positive with respect to terminal B. If we
later find that v happens to have a numerical value of −5 V, then we may say
either that A is −5 V positive with respect to B or that B is 5 V positive with
respect to A. Other cases are shown in Fig. 2.9b, c, and d.
Just as we noted in our definition of current, it is essential to realize that
the plus-minus pair of algebraic signs does not indicate the “actual” polarity
of the voltage but is simply part of a convention that enables us to talk unam-
biguously about “the voltage across the terminal pair.” The definition of any
voltage must include a plus-minus sign pair! Using a quantity v 1 (t) without
specifying the location of the plus-minus sign pair is using an undefined
term. Figure 2.10a and b do not serve as definitions of v 1 (t); Fig. 2.10c does.
(2) We are probably fortunate that the full name of the 18th century Italian physicist, Alessandro Giuseppe
Antonio Anastasio Volta, is not used for our unit of potential difference!15

Power
We have already defined power, and we will represent it by P or p. If one
joule of energy is expended in transferring one coulomb of charge through
the device in one second, then the rate of energy transfer is one watt. The
absorbed power must be proportional both to the number of coulombs trans-
ferred per second (current) and to the energy needed to transfer one
coulomb through the element (voltage). Thus,
p = vi
[3]
Dimensionally, the right side of this equation is the product of joules per
coulomb and coulombs per second, which produces the expected dimension
of joules per second, or watts. The conventions for current, voltage, and
power are shown in Fig. 2.12.
We now have an expression for the power being absorbed by a circuit
element in terms of a voltage across it and current through it. Voltage was
defined in terms of an energy expenditure, and power is the rate at which en-
ergy is expended. However, no statement can be made concerning energy
transfer in any of the four cases shown in Fig. 2.9, for example, until the
direction of the current is specified. Let us imagine that a current arrow is
placed alongside each upper lead, directed to the right, and labeled “+2 A.”
First, consider the case shown in Fig. 2.9c. Terminal A is 5 V positive with
respect to terminal B, which means that 5 J of energy is required to move
each coulomb of positive charge into terminal A, through the object, and out
terminal B. Since we are injecting +2 A (a current of 2 coulombs of positive
charge per second) into terminal A, we are doing (5 J/C) × (2 C/s) 10 J of
work per second on the object. In other words, the object is absorbing 10 W
of power from whatever is injecting the current.
We know from an earlier discussion that there is no difference between
Fig. 2.9c and Fig. 2.9d, so we expect the object depicted in Fig. 2.9d to also
be absorbing 10 W. We can check this easily enough: we are injecting +2 A
into terminal A of the object, so +2 A flows out of terminal B. Another way
of saying this is that we are injecting −2 A of current into terminal B. It
takes −5 J/C to move charge from terminal B to terminal A, so the object is
absorbing (−5 J/C) × (−2 C/s) +10 W as expected. The only difficulty
in describing this particular case is keeping the minus signs straight, but
with a bit of care we see the correct answer can be obtained regardless of
our choice of positive reference terminal (terminal A in Fig. 2.9c, and
terminal B in Fig. 2.9d).

■ FIGURE 2.12 The power absorbed by the element
is given by the product p vi. Alternatively, we
can say that the element generates or supplies a
power −vi.16
CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
If the current arrow is directed into the “+” marked ter-
minal of an element, then p vi yields the absorbed
power. A negative value indicates that power is actually
being generated by the element.
If the current arrow is directed out of the “+” terminal
of an element, then p vi yields the supplied power.
A negative value in this case indicates that power is
being absorbed.
Now let’s look at the situation depicted in Fig. 2.9a, again with +2 A in-
jected into terminal A. Since it takes −5 J/C to move charge from terminal
A to terminal B, the object is absorbing (−5 J/C) × (2 C/s) −10 W. What
does this mean? How can anything absorb negative power? If we think
about this in terms of energy transfer, −10 J is transferred to the object each
second through the 2 A current flowing into terminal A. The object is actu-
ally losing energy—at a rate of 10 J/s. In other words, it is supplying 10 J/s
(i.e., 10 W) to some other object not shown in the figure. Negative absorbed
power, then, is equivalent to positive supplied power.
Let’s recap. Figure 2.12 shows that if one terminal of the element is v volts
positive with respect to the other terminal, and if a current i is entering the
element through that terminal, then a power p = vi is being absorbed by
the element; it is also correct to say that a power p = vi is being delivered
to the element. When the current arrow is directed into the element at the
plus-marked terminal, we satisfy the passive sign convention. This conven-
tion should be studied carefully, understood, and memorized. In other words,
it says that if the current arrow and the voltage polarity signs are placed such
that the current enters that end of the element marked with the positive sign,
then the power absorbed by the element can be expressed by the product
of the specified current and voltage variables. If the numerical value of the
product is negative, then we say that the element is absorbing negative
power, or that it is actually generating power and delivering it to some exter-
nal element. For example, in Fig. 2.12 with v = 5 V and i = −4 A, the
element may be described as either absorbing −20 W or generating 20 W.
Conventions are only required when there is more than one way to do
something, and confusion may result when two different groups try to
communicate. For example, it is rather arbitrary to always place “North” at
the top of a map; compass needles don’t point “up,” anyway. Still, if we
were talking to people who had secretly chosen the opposite convention of
placing “South” at the top of their maps, imagine the confusion that could
result! In the same fashion, there is a general convention that always draws
the current arrows pointing into the positive voltage terminal, regardless of
whether the element supplies or absorbs power. This convention is not in-
correct but sometimes results in counterintuitive currents labeled on circuit
schematics. The reason for this is that it simply seems more natural to refer
to positive current flowing out of a voltage or current source that is supply-
ing positive power to one or more circuit elements.

In Fig. 2.13a, we see that the reference current is defined consistent
with the passive sign convention, which assumes that the element is
absorbing power. With +3 A flowing into the positive reference termi-
nal, we compute
P = (2 V)(3 A) = 6 W
of power absorbed by the element.
Figure 2.13b shows a slightly different picture. Now, we have a cur-
rent of −3 A flowing into the positive reference terminal. This gives us
an absorbed power
P = (−2 V)(−3 A) = 6 W
Thus, we see that the two cases are actually equivalent: A current
of +3 A flowing into the top terminal is the same as a current of +3 A
flowing out of the bottom terminal, or, equivalently, a current of −3 A
flowing into the bottom terminal.
Referring to Fig. 2.13c, we again apply the passive sign convention
rules and compute an absorbed power
P = (4 V)(−5 A) = −20 W
Since we computed a negative absorbed power, this tells us that the
element in Fig. 2.13c is actually supplying +20 W (i.e., it’s a source of
energy).

VOLTAGE AND CURRENT SOURCES
Using the concepts of current and voltage, it is now possible to be more spe-
cific in defining a circuit element.
In so doing, it is important to differentiate between the physical device
itself and the mathematical model which we will use to analyze its behavior
in a circuit. The model is only an approximation.
1718
CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
By definition, a simple circuit element is the
mathematical model of a two-terminal electrical
device, and it can be completely characterized by its
voltage-current relationship; it cannot be subdivided
into other two-terminal devices.

■ FIGURE 2.15 Circuit symbol of the independent
voltage source.
If you’ve ever noticed the room lights dim when an
air conditioner kicks on, it’s because the sudden large
current demand temporarily led to a voltage drop. After
the motor starts moving, it takes less current to keep it
in motion. At that point, the current demand is reduced,
the voltage returns to its original value, and the wall
outlet again provides a reasonable approximation of
an ideal voltage source.
Let us agree that we will use the expression circuit element to refer to the
mathematical model. The choice of a particular model for any real device
must be made on the basis of experimental data or experience; we will usually
assume that this choice has already been made. For simplicity, we initially
consider circuits with idealized components represented by simple models.
All the simple circuit elements that we will consider can be classified ac-
cording to the relationship of the current through the element to the voltage
across the element. For example, if the voltage across the element is linearly
proportional to the current through it, we will call the element a resistor.
Other types of simple circuit elements have terminal voltages which are
proportional to the derivative of the current with respect to time (an induc-
tor), or to the integral of the current with respect to time (a capacitor). There
are also elements in which the voltage is completely independent of the cur-
rent, or the current is completely independent of the voltage; these are
termed independent sources. Furthermore, we will need to define special
kinds of sources for which either the source voltage or current depends upon
a current or voltage elsewhere in the circuit; such sources are referred to as
dependent sources. Dependent sources are used a great deal in electronics to
model both dc and ac behavior of transistors, especially in amplifier circuits.
Independent Voltage Sources
The first element we will consider is the independent voltage source. The
circuit symbol is shown in Fig. 2.15a; the subscript s merely identifies the
voltage as a “source” voltage, and is common but not required. An inde-
pendent voltage source is characterized by a terminal voltage which is
completely independent of the current through it. Thus, if we are given an
independent voltage source and are notified that the terminal voltage is 12 V,
then we always assume this voltage, regardless of the current flowing.
The independent voltage source is an ideal source and does not repre-
sent exactly any real physical device, because the ideal source could theo-
retically deliver an infinite amount of energy from its terminals. This ideal-
ized voltage source does, however, furnish a reasonable approximation to
several practical voltage sources. An automobile storage battery, for exam-
ple, has a 12 V terminal voltage that remains essentially constant as long as
the current through it does not exceed a few amperes. A small current may
flow in either direction through the battery. If it is positive and flowing out
of the positively marked terminal, then the battery is furnishing power to the
headlights, for example; if the current is positive and flowing into the posi-
tive terminal, then the battery is charging by absorbing energy from the
alternator. 3 An ordinary household electrical outlet also √
approximates an
independent voltage source, providing a voltage v s = 115 2 cos 2π60t V;
this representation is valid for currents less than 20 A or so.
A point worth repeating here is that the presence of the plus sign at the
upper end of the symbol for the independent voltage source in Fig. 2.15a
does not necessarily mean that the upper terminal is numerically positive
with respect to the lower terminal. Instead, it means that the upper terminal
is v s volts positive with respect to the lower. If at some instant v s happens
to be negative, then the upper terminal is actually negative with respect to
the lower at that instant.
(3) Or the battery of a friend’s car, if you accidentally left your headlights on. . .19
SECTION 2.3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT SOURCES
Consider a current arrow labeled “i” placed adjacent to the upper conduc-
tor of the source as in Fig. 2.15b. The current i is entering the terminal at which
the positive sign is located, the passive sign convention is satisfied, and the
source thus absorbs power p = v s i. More often than not, a source is expected
to deliver power to a network and not to absorb it. Consequently, we might
choose to direct the arrow as in Fig. 2.15c so that v s i will represent the power
delivered by the source. Technically, either arrow direction may be chosen;
whenever possible, we will adopt the convention of Fig. 2.15c in this text for
voltage and current sources, which are not usually considered passive devices.
An independent voltage source with a constant terminal voltage is often
termed an independent dc voltage source and can be represented by either of
the symbols shown in Fig. 2.16a and b. Note in Fig. 2.16b that when the
physical plate structure of the battery is suggested, the longer plate is placed
at the positive terminal; the plus and minus signs then represent redundant
notation, but they are usually included anyway. For the sake of complete-
ness, the symbol for an independent ac voltage source is shown in Fig. 2.16c.

Terms like dc voltage source and dc current source are
commonly used. Literally, they mean “direct-current
voltage source” and “direct-current current source,”
respectively. Although these terms may seem a little
odd or even redundant, the terminology is so widely
used there’s no point in fighting it.
Independent Current Sources
Another ideal source which we will need is the independent current
source. Here, the current through the element is completely independent of
the voltage across it. The symbol for an independent current source is
shown in Fig. 2.17. If i s is constant, we call the source an independent dc
current source. An ac current source is often drawn with a tilde through the
arrow, similar to the ac voltage source shown in Fig. 2.16c.
Like the independent voltage source, the independent current source is
at best a reasonable approximation for a physical element. In theory it can
deliver infinite power from its terminals because it produces the same finite
current for any voltage across it, no matter how large that voltage may be. It
is, however, a good approximation for many practical sources, particularly
in electronic circuits.
Although most students seem happy enough with an independent volt-
age source providing a fixed voltage but essentially any current, it is a com-
mon mistake to view an independent current source as having zero voltage
across its terminals while providing a fixed current. In fact, we do not know
a priori what the voltage across a current source will be—it depends entirely
on the circuit to which it is connected.
i s
■ FIGURE 2.17 Circuit symbol for the independent
current source.
Dependent Sources
The two types of ideal sources that we have discussed up to now are called
independent sources because the value of the source quantity is not affected
in any way by activities in the remainder of the circuit. This is in contrast
with yet another kind of ideal source, the dependent, or controlled, source,
in which the source quantity is determined by a voltage or current existing
at some other location in the system being analyzed. Sources such as these
appear in the equivalent electrical models for many electronic devices, such
as transistors, operational amplifiers, and integrated circuits. To distinguish
between dependent and independent sources, we introduce the diamond
symbols shown in Fig. 2.18. In Fig. 2.18a and c, K is a dimensionless scaling
constant. In Fig.2.18b, g is a scaling factor with units of A/V; in Fig. 2.18d,
r is a scaling factor with units of V/A. The controlling current i x and the
controlling voltage v x must be defined in the circuit.

CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
It does seem odd at first to have a current source whose value depends
on a voltage, or a voltage source which is controlled by a current flowing
through some other element. Even a voltage source depending on a remote
voltage can appear strange. Such sources are invaluable for modeling com-
plex systems, however, making the analysis algebraically straightforward.
Examples include the drain current of a field effect transistor as a function
of the gate voltage, or the output voltage of an analog integrated circuit as a
function of differential input voltage. When encountered during circuit
analysis, we write down the entire controlling expression for the dependent
source just as we would if it was a numerical value attached to an indepen-
dent source. This often results in the need for an additional equation to
complete the analysis, unless the controlling voltage or current is already
one of the specified unknowns in our system of equations.

ing the circuit diagram, we notice that the desired voltage v L is the
same as the voltage across the dependent source. Thus,

An important lesson at this early stage of the game is that the time
it takes to completely label a circuit diagram is always a good invest-
ment. As a final step, we should go back and check over our work to
ensure that the result is correct.

–SECTION 2.3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT SOURCES
Dependent and independent voltage and current sources are active ele-
ments; they are capable of delivering power to some external device. For
the present we will think of a passive element as one which is capable only
of receiving power. However, we will later see that several passive elements
are able to store finite amounts of energy and then return that energy later to
various external devices; since we still wish to call such elements passive, it
will be necessary to improve upon our two definitions a little later.
Networks and Circuits
The interconnection of two or more simple circuit elements forms an elec-
trical network. If the network contains at least one closed path, it is also an
electric circuit. Note: Every circuit is a network, but not all networks are
circuits (see Fig. 2.21)!

A network that contains at least one active element, such as an indepen-
dent voltage or current source, is an active network. A network that does not
contain any active elements is a passive network.
We have now defined what we mean by the term circuit element, and
we have presented the definitions of several specific circuit elements, the
independent and dependent voltage and current sources. Throughout the
remainder of the book we will define only five additional circuit elements:
the resistor, inductor, capacitor, transformer, and the ideal operational ampli-
fier (“op amp,” for short). These are all ideal elements. They are important
because we may combine them into networks and circuits that represent real
devices as accurately as we require. Thus, the transistor shown in Fig. 2.22a
and b may be modeled by the voltage terminals designated v gs and the single
dependent current source of Fig. 2.22c. Note that the dependent current
source produces a current that depends on a voltage elsewhere in the circuit.
The parameter g m , commonly referred to as the transconductance, is
calculated using transistor-specific details as well as the operating point de-
termined by the circuit connected to the transistor. It is generally a small
number, on the order of 10 −2 to perhaps 10 A/V. This model works pretty well
as long as the frequency of any sinusoidal source is neither very large nor
very small; the model can be modified to account for frequency-dependent

capacitors.
Similar (but much smaller) transistors typically constitute only one
small part of an integrated circuit that may be less than 2 mm × 2 mm
square and 200 μm thick and yet contains several thousand transistors plus
various resistors and capacitors. Thus, we may have a physical device that
is about the size of one letter on this page but requires a model composed of
ten thousand ideal simple circuit elements. We use this concept of “circuit
modeling” in a number of electrical engineering topics covered in other
courses, including electronics, energy conversion, and antennas.

OHM’S LAW
So far, we have been introduced to both dependent and independent voltage
and current sources and were cautioned that they were idealized active ele-
ments that could only be approximated in a real circuit. We are now ready
to meet another idealized element, the linear resistor. The resistor is the sim-
plest passive element, and we begin our discussion by considering the work
of an obscure German physicist, Georg Simon Ohm, who published a pam-
phlet in 1827 that described the results of one of the first efforts to measure
currents and voltages, and to describe and relate them mathematically. One
result was a statement of the fundamental relationship we now call Ohm’s
law, even though it has since been shown that this result was discovered
46 years earlier in England by Henry Cavendish, a brilliant semirecluse.
Ohm’s law states that the voltage across conducting materials is directly
proportional to the current flowing through the material, or
v = Ri
[4]
where the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance. The unit of
resistance is the ohm, which is 1 V/A and customarily abbreviated by a
capital omega, .23
SECTION 2.4 OHM’S LAW
When this equation is plotted on i-versus-v axes, the graph is a straight
line passing through the origin (Fig. 2.23). Equation [4] is a linear equation,
and we will consider it as the definition of a linear resistor. Resistance is
normally considered to be a positive quantity, although negative resistances
may be simulated with special circuitry.
Again, it must be emphasized that the linear resistor is an idealized
circuit element; it is only a mathematical model of a real, physical device.
“Resistors” may be easily purchased or manufactured, but it is soon found
that the voltage-current ratios of these physical devices are reasonably con-
stant only within certain ranges of current, voltage, or power, and depend
also on temperature and other environmental factors. We usually refer to a
linear resistor as simply a resistor; any resistor that is nonlinear will always
be described as such. Nonlinear resistors should not necessarily be consid-
ered undesirable elements. Although it is true that their presence compli-
cates an analysis, the performance of the device may depend on or be greatly
improved by the nonlinearity. For example, fuses for overcurrent protection
and Zener diodes for voltage regulation are very nonlinear in nature, a fact
that is exploited when using them in circuit design.
Power Absorption
Figure 2.24 shows several different resistor packages, as well as the most
common circuit symbol used for a resistor. In accordance with the voltage,
current, and power conventions already adopted, the product of v and i
gives the power absorbed by the resistor. That is, v and i are selected to
satisfy the passive sign convention. The absorbed power appears physically

element that cannot deliver power or store energy. Alternative expressions
for the absorbed power are

[5]
One of the authors (who shall remain anonymous) had the unfortunate
experience of inadvertently connecting a 100 , 2 W carbon resistor across
a 110 V source. The ensuing flame, smoke, and fragmentation were rather
disconcerting, demonstrating clearly that a practical resistor has definite
limits to its ability to behave like the ideal linear model. In this case, the un-
fortunate resistor was called upon to absorb 121 W; since it was designed to
handle only 2 W, its reaction was understandably violent.

which causes a current of 42.4 mA to flow th ough it. Calculate the
voltage across the resistor and the power it is dissipating.
The voltage across the resistor is given by Ohm’s law:
v = Ri = (560)(0.0424) = 23.7 V
The dissipated power can be calculated in several different ways. For
instance,
p = vi = (23.7)(0.0424) = 1.005 W
Alternatively,
p = v 2 /R = (23.7) 2 /560 = 1.003 W
or
p = i 2 R = (0.0424) 2 (560) = 1.007 W
We note several things.
First, we calculated the power in three different ways, and we seem
to have obtained three different answers!
In reality, however, we rounded our voltage to three significant
digits, which will impact the accuracy of any subsequent quantity we
calculate with it. With this in mind, we see that the answers show rea-
sonable agreement (within 1%).
The other point worth noting is that the resistor is rated to 50 W—
since we are only dissipating approximately 2% of this value, the resis-
tor is in no danger of overheating.

Ans: 22 M ; 500 μ W; 42.3 pW.PRACTICAL APPLICATION
Wire Gauge
Technically speaking, any material (except for a super-
conductor) will provide resistance to current flow. As in
all introductory circuits texts, however, we tacitly as-
sume that wires appearing in circuit diagrams have zero
resistance. This implies that there is no potential differ-
ence between the ends of a wire, and hence no power
absorbed or heat generated. Although usually not an
unreasonable assumption, it does neglect practical con-
siderations when choosing the appropriate wire diameter
for a specific application.
Resistance is determined by (1) the inherent resistiv-
ity of a material and (2) the device geometry. Resistivity,
represented by the symbol ρ, is a measure of the ease
with which electrons can travel through a certain mater-
ial. Since it is the ratio of the electric field (V/m) to the
areal density of current flowing in the material (A/m 2 ),
the general unit of ρ is an · m, although metric pre-
fixes are often employed. Every material has a different
inherent resistivity, which depends on temperature.
Some examples are shown in Table 2.3; as can be seen,
there is a small variation between different types of cop-
per (less than 1%) but a very large difference between
different metals. In particular, although physically
stronger than copper, steel wire is several times more
resistive. In some technical discussions, it is more
common to see the conductivity (symbolized by σ) of a
material quoted, which is simply the reciprocal of the
resistivity.
The resistance of a particular object is obtained by
multiplying the resistivity by the length of the resistor
and dividing by the cross-sectional area (A) as in Eq. [6];
these parameters are illustrated in Fig. 2.26.

resistance of a wire. The resistivity of the material is assumed to be spatially
uniform.
We determine the resistivity when we select the
material from which to fabricate a wire and measure the
temperature of the application environment. Since a
finite amount of power is absorbed by the wire due to its
resistance, current flow leads to the production of heat.
Thicker wires have lower resistance and also dissipate
heat more easily but are heavier, take up a larger volume,
and are more expensive. Thus, we are motivated by
practical considerations to choose the smallest wire that

EXAMPLE 2.4
A dc power link is to be made between two islands separated by a
distance of 24 miles. The operating voltage is 500 kV and the sys-
tem capacity is 600 MW. Calculate the maximum dc current flo ,
and estimate the resistivity of the cable, assuming a diameter of
2.5 cm and a solid (not stranded) wire.
Dividing the maximum power (600 MW, or 600 × 10 6 W)

yields a maximum current of

2.13 A 500 ft long 24 AWG soft copper wire is carrying a current of
100 mA. What is the voltage dropped across the wire?
Ans: 3.26 V.
Conductance
For a linear resistor the ratio of current to voltage is also a constant
i

=

v
R
[7]
where G is called the conductance. The SI unit of conductance is the
siemens (S), 1 A/V. An older, unofficial unit for conductance is the mho,
which was often abbreviated as
and is still occasionally written as −1 .
You will occasionally see it used on some circuit diagrams, as well as in cat-
alogs and texts. The same circuit symbol (Fig. 2.24d) is used to represent
both resistance and conductance. The absorbed power is again necessarily
positive and may be expressed in terms of the conductance by
p = vi = v 2 G =
i 2
G
[8]
Thus a 2 resistor has a conductance of 12 S, and if a current of 5 A is
flowing through it, then a voltage of 10 V is present across the terminals and
a power of 50 W is being absorbed.
All the expressions given so far in this section were written in terms
of instantaneous current, voltage, and power, such as v = iR and p = vi .
We should recall that this is a shorthand notation for v(t) = Ri(t) and
p(t) = v(t) i(t). The current through and voltage across a resistor must
both vary with time in the same manner. Thus, if R = 10
and
v = 2 sin 100t V, then i = 0.2 sin 100t A. Note that the power is given by
0.4 sin 2 100t W, and a simple sketch will illustrate the different nature of
its variation with time. Although the current and voltage are each negative
during certain time intervals, the absorbed power is never negative!
Resistance may be used as the basis for defining two commonly used
terms, short circuit and open circuit. We define a short circuit as a resistance
of zero ohms; then, since v = iR, the voltage across a short circuit must
be zero, although the current may have any value. In an analogous manner,
2728
CHAPTER 2 BASIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRIC CIRCUITS
we define an open circuit as an infinite resistance. It follows from Ohm’s law
that the current must be zero, regardless of the voltage across the open circuit.
Although real wires have a small resistance associated with them, we always
assume them to have zero resistance unless otherwise specified. Thus, in all
of our circuit schematics, wires are taken to be perfect short circuits.
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In this chapter, we introduced the topic of units – specifically those relevant
to electrical circuits—and their relationship to fundamental (SI) units. We
also discussed current and current sources, voltage and voltage sources, and
the fact that the product of voltage and current yields power (the rate of
energy consumption or generation). Since power can be either positive or
negative depending on the current direction and voltage polarity, the pas-
sive sign convention was described to ensure we always know if an element
is absorbing or supplying energy to the rest of the circuit. Four additional
sources were introduced, forming a general class known as dependent
sources. They are often used to model complex systems and electrical com-
ponents, but the actual value of voltage or current supplied is typically
unknown until the entire circuit is analyzed. We concluded the chapter with
the resistor—by far the most common circuit element—whose voltage and
current are linearly related (described by Ohm’s law). Whereas the resistiv-
ity of a material is one of its fundamental properties (measured in · cm),
resistance describes a device property (measured in ) and hence depends
not only on resistivity but on the device geometry (i.e., length and area)
as well.
We conclude with key points of this chapter to review, along with ap-
propriate examples.

Note that a current represented by i or i(t ) can be
constant (dc) or time-varying, but currents represented
by the symbol I must be non-time-varying.

The system of units most commonly used in electrical engineering is
the SI.
The direction in which positive charges are moving is the direction of
positive current flow; alternatively, positive current flow is in the
direction opposite that of moving electrons.
To define a current, both a value and a direction must be given.
Currents are typically denoted by the uppercase letter “I” for constant
(dc) values, and either i(t) or simply i otherwise.
To define a voltage across an element, it is necessary to label the
terminals with “+” and “−” signs as well as to provide a value (either
an algebraic symbol or a numerical value).
Any element is said to supply positive power if positive current flows
out of the positive voltage terminal. Any element absorbs positive
power if positive current flows into the positive voltage terminal.
(Example 2.1)
There are six sources: the independent voltage source, the independent
current source, the current-controlled dependent current source, the
voltage-controlled dependent current source, the voltage-controlled
dependent voltage source, and the current-controlled dependent voltage
source. (Example 2.2)EXERCISES

Ohm’s law states that the voltage across a linear resistor is directly
proportional to the current flowing through it; i.e., v = Ri. (Example 2.3)
The power dissipated by a resistor (which leads to the production of
heat) is given by p = vi = i 2 R = v 2 /R. (Example 2.3)
Wires are typically assumed to have zero resistance in circuit analysis.
When selecting a wire gauge for a specific application, however, local
electrical and fire codes must be consulted. (Example 2.4)

KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
In Chap. 2 we were introduced to independent voltage and current
sources, dependent sources, and resistors. We discovered that
dependent sources come in four varieties, and are controlled by a
voltage or current which exists elsewhere. Once we know the
voltage across a resistor, we know its current (and vice versa);
this is not the case for sources, however. In general, circuits must
be analyzed to determine a complete set of voltages and currents.
This turns out to be reasonably straightforward, and only two
simple laws are needed in addition to Ohm’s law. These new laws
are Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law
(KVL), and they are simply restatements of charge and energy
conservation, respectively. They apply to any circuit we will ever
encounter, although in later chapters we will learn more efficient
techniques for specific types of situations.

NODES, PATHS, LOOPS, AND BRANCHES
We now focus our attention on the current-voltage relationships in
simple networks of two or more circuit elements. The elements will
be connected by wires (sometimes referred to as “leads”), which have
zero resistance. Since the network then appears as a number of sim-
ple elements and a set of connecting leads, it is called a lumped-
parameter network. A more difficult analysis problem arises when
we are faced with a distributed-parameter network, which contains
an essentially infinite number of vanishingly small elements. We will
concentrate on lumped-parameter networks in this text.

CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS
In circuits assembled in the real world, the wires will
always have finite resistance. However, this resistance
is typically so small compared to other resistances in
the circuit that we can neglect it without introducing
significant error. In our idealized circuits, we will
therefore refer to “zero resistance” wires from now on.

A point at which two or more elements have a common connection is
called a node. For example, Fig. 3.1a shows a circuit containing three
nodes. Sometimes networks are drawn so as to trap an unwary student into
believing that there are more nodes present than is actually the case. This
occurs when a node, such as node 1 in Fig. 3.1a, is shown as two separate
junctions connected by a (zero-resistance) conductor, as in Fig. 3.1b. How-
ever, all that has been done is to spread the common point out into a
common zero-resistance line. Thus, we must necessarily consider all of the
perfectly conducting leads or portions of leads attached to the node as part
of the node. Note also that every element has a node at each of its ends.
Suppose that we start at one node in a network and move through a sim-
ple element to the node at the other end. We then continue from that node
through a different element to the next node, and continue this movement
until we have gone through as many elements as we wish. If no node was
encountered more than once, then the set of nodes and elements that we
have passed through is defined as a path. If the node at which we started is
the same as the node on which we ended, then the path is, by definition, a
closed path or a loop.
For example, in Fig. 3.1a, if we move from node 2 through the current
source to node 1, and then through the upper right resistor to node 3, we
have established a path; since we have not continued on to node 2 again, we
have not made a loop. If we proceeded from node 2 through the current
source to node 1, down through the left resistor to node 2, and then up
through the central resistor to node 1 again, we do not have a path, since a
node (actually two nodes) was encountered more than once; we also do not
have a loop, because a loop must be a path.
Another term whose use will prove convenient is branch. We define a
branch as a single path in a network, composed of one simple element and
the node at each end of that element. Thus, a path is a particular collection
of branches. The circuit shown in Fig. 3.1a and b contains five branches.

KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW
We are now ready to consider the first of the two laws named for Gustav
Robert Kirchhoff (two h’s and two f ’s), a German university professor who
was born about the time Ohm was doing his experimental work. This
axiomatic law is called Kirchhoff’s current law (abbreviated KCL), and
it simply states that
The algebraic sum of the currents entering any node is zero.
This law represents a mathematical statement of the fact that charge
cannot accumulate at a node. A node is not a circuit element, and it certainly
cannot store, destroy, or generate charge. Hence, the currents must sum to
zero. A hydraulic analogy is sometimes useful here: for example, consider
three water pipes joined in the shape of a Y. We define three “currents” as
flowing into each of the three pipes. If we insist that water is always flow-
ing, then obviously we cannot have three positive water currents, or the
pipes would burst. This is a result of our defining currents independent of41
SECTION 3.2 KIRCHHOFF’S CURRENT LAW
the direction that water is actually flowing. Therefore, the value of either
one or two of the currents as defined must be negative.
Consider the node shown in Fig. 3.2. The algebraic sum of the four cur-
rents entering the node must be zero:
i A + i B + (−i C ) + (−i D ) = 0
However, the law could be equally well applied to the algebraic sum of
the currents leaving the node:
i A
i B
i D
i C
■ FIGURE 3.2 Example node to illustrate the applica-
tion of Kirchhoff’s current law.
(−i A ) + (−i B ) + i C + i D = 0
We might also wish to equate the sum of the currents having reference
arrows directed into the node to the sum of those directed out of the node:
i A + i B = i C + i D
which simply states that the sum of the currents going in must equal the sum
of the currents going out.

the other supplies 3 A. There are no other sources, independent or

KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW
Current is related to the charge flowing through a circuit element, whereas
voltage is a measure of potential energy difference across the element.
There is a single unique value for any voltage in circuit theory. Thus, the en-
ergy required to move a unit charge from point A to point B in a circuit must
have a value independent of the path chosen to get from A to B (there is
often more than one such path). We may assert this fact through Kirchhoff’s
voltage law (abbreviated KVL):
C

•
In Fig. 3.5, if we carry a charge of 1 C from A to B through element 1,
the reference polarity signs for v 1 show that we do v 1 joules of work. 1 Now
(1) Note that we chose a 1 C charge for the sake of numerical convenience: therefore, we did
(1 C)(v 1 J/C) = v 1 joules of work.43
SECTION 3.3 KIRCHHOFF’S VOLTAGE LAW
if, instead, we choose to proceed from A to B via node C, then we expend
(v 2 − v 3 ) joules of energy. The work done, however, is independent of the
path in a circuit, and so any route must lead to the same value for the volt-
age. In other words,
v 1 = v 2 − v 3
[3]
It follows that if we trace out a closed path, the algebraic sum of the volt-
ages across the individual elements around it must be zero. Thus, we may
write
v 1 + v 2 + v 3 + · · · + v N = 0
or, more compactly,
N
v n = 0
[4]
n=1
We can apply KVL to a circuit in several different ways. One method
that leads to fewer equation-writing errors than others consists of moving
mentally around the closed path in a clockwise direction and writing down
directly the voltage of each element whose (+) terminal is entered, and
writing down the negative of every voltage first met at the (−) sign. Apply-
ing this to the single loop of Fig. 3.5, we have
−v 1 + v 2 − v 3 = 0
which agrees with our previous result, Eq. [3].
EXAMPLE 3.2
In the circuit of Fig. 3.6, find v x and i x .
We know the voltage across two of the three elements in the circuit.
Thus, KVL can be applied immediately to obtain v x .
Beginning with the bottom node of the 5 V source, we apply KVL
clockwise around the loop:
7 V
– +
−5 − 7 + v x = 0
so v x = 12 V.
KCL applies to this circuit, but only tells us that the same current
(i x ) flows through all three elements. We now know the voltage across
the 100 resistor, however.

In the circuit of Fig. 3.8 there are eight circuit elements. Find v R2
(the voltage across R 2 ) and the voltage labeled v x .
The best approach for finding v R2 is to look for a loop to which we can
apply KVL. There are several options, but the leftmost loop offers a
straightforward route, as two of the voltages are clearly specified. Thus,
we find v R2 by writing a KVL equation around the loop on the left,
starting at point c:
4 − 36 + v R2 = 0
which leads to v R2 = 32 V.

To find v x , we might think of this as the (algebraic) sum of the volt-
ages across the three elements on the right. However, since we do not
have values for these quantities, such an approach would not lead to a
numerical answer. Instead, we apply KVL beginning at point c, moving
up and across the top to a, through v x to b, and through the conducting
lead to the starting point:
+4 − 36 + 12 + 14 + v x = 0
so that
v x = 6 V
An alternative approach: Knowing v R2 , we might have taken the
shortcut through R 2 :

yielding v x = 6 V once again.

As we have just seen, the key to correctly analyzing a circuit is to first me-
thodically label all voltages and currents on the diagram. This way, carefully
written KCL or KVL equations will yield correct relationships, and Ohm’s
law can be applied as necessary if more unknowns than equations are ob-
tained initially. We illustrate these principles with a more detailed example.

KVL. (b) Circuit with voltages and currents labeled.
We begin by labeling voltages and currents on the rest of the elements
in the circuit (Fig. 3.10b). Note that v x appears across the 2 resistor
and the source i x as well.
If we can obtain the current through the 2 resistor, Ohm’s law will
yield v x . Writing the appropriate KCL equation, we see that
i 2 = i 4 + i x
Unfortunately, we do not have values for any of these three quanti-
ties. Our solution has (temporarily) stalled.
Since we were given the current flowing from the 60 V source, per-
haps we should consider starting from that side of the circuit. Instead of
finding v x using i 2 , it might be possible to find v x directly using KVL.
We can write the following KVL equations:
−60 + v 8 + v 10 = 0
and
−v 10 + v 4 + v x = 0
[5]
This is progress: we now have two equations in four unknowns, an
improvement over one equation in which all terms were unknown. In
fact, we know that v 8 = 40 V through Ohm’s law, as we were told that
5 A flows through the 8 resistor. Thus, v 10 = 0 + 60 − 40 = 20 V,
(Continued on next page)46
CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS
so Eq. [5] reduces to
v x = 20 − v 4
If we can determine v 4 , the problem is solved.
The best route to finding a numerical value for the voltage v 4 in this
case is to employ Ohm’s law, which requires a value for i 4 . From KCL,
we see that
v 10

THE SINGLE-LOOP CIRCUIT
We have seen that repeated use of KCL and KVL in conjunction with Ohm’s
law can be applied to nontrivial circuits containing several loops and a num-
ber of different elements. Before proceeding further, this is a good time to
focus on the concept of series (and, in the next section, parallel) circuits, as
they form the basis of any network we will encounter in the future.
All of the elements in a circuit that carry the same current are said to be
connected in series. As an example, consider the circuit of Fig. 3.10. The
60 V source is in series with the 8 resistor; they carry the same 5 A cur-
rent. However, the 8 resistor is not in series with the 4 resistor; they
carry different currents. Note that elements may carry equal currents and
not be in series; two 100 W light bulbs in neighboring houses may very well
carry equal currents, but they certainly do not carry the same current and are
not connected in series.
Figure 3.12a shows a simple circuit consisting of two batteries and
two resistors. Each terminal, connecting lead, and solder glob is assumed to
have zero resistance; together they constitute an individual node of the circuit
diagram in Fig. 3.12b. Both batteries are modeled by ideal voltage sources;
any internal resistances they may have are assumed to be small enough to
neglect. The two resistors are assumed to be ideal (linear) resistors.
We seek the current through each element, the voltage across each ele-
ment, and the power absorbed by each element. Our first step in the analy-
sis is the assumption of reference directions for the unknown currents.
Arbitrarily, let us select a clockwise current i which flows out of the upper
terminal of the voltage source on the left. This choice is indicated by an ar-
row labeled i at that point in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 3.12c. A trivialSECTION 3.4 THE SINGLE-LOOP CIRCUIT
47
application of Kirchhoff’s current law assures us that this same current must
also flow through every other element in the circuit; we emphasize this fact
this one time by placing several other current symbols about the circuit.
Our second step in the analysis is a choice of the voltage reference for each
of the two resistors. The passive sign convention requires that the resistor cur-
rent and voltage variables be defined so that the current enters the terminal at
which the positive voltage reference is located. Since we already (arbitrarily)
selected the current direction,v R1 andv R2 are defined as in Fig. 3.12c.
The third step is the application of Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the only
closed path. Let us decide to move around the circuit in the clockwise
direction, beginning at the lower left corner, and to write down directly
every voltage first met at its positive reference, and to write down the nega-
tive of every voltage encountered at the negative terminal. Thus,
−v s1 + v R1 + v s2 + v R2 = 0
[6]
We then apply Ohm’s law to the resistive elements:
v R1 = R 1 i
and v R2 = R 2 i
Substituting into Eq. [6] yields
−v s1 + R 1 i + v s2 + R 2 i = 0
Since i is the only unknown, we find that
i =
v s1 − v s2
R 1 + R 2
The voltage or power associated with any element may now be obtained by
applying v = Ri, p = vi , or p = i 2 R.

CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS
We first assign a reference direction for the current i and a reference po-
larity for the voltage v 30 as shown in Fig. 3.13b. There is no need to as-
sign a voltage to the 15 resistor, since the controlling voltage v A for
the dependent source is already available. (It is worth noting, however,
that the reference signs for v A are reversed from those we would have
assigned based on the passive sign convention.)
This circuit contains a dependent voltage source, the value of which
remains unknown until we determine v A . However, its algebraic value
2v A can be used in the same fashion as if a numerical value were avail-
able. Thus, applying KVL around the loop:
−120 + v 30 + 2v A − v A = 0
[7]
Using Ohm’s law to introduce the known resistor values:
v 30 = 30i
and v A = −15i
Note that the negative sign is required since i flows into the negative
terminal of v A .
Substituting into Eq. [7] yields
−120 + 30i − 30i + 15i = 0
and so we find that
i = 8A
Computing the power absorbed by each element:
p 120 v = (120)(−8) = −960 W
p 30 = (8) 2 (30) = 1920 W
p dep = (2v A )(8) = 2[(−15)(8)](8)

five elements in the circuit.
Ans: (CW from left) 0.768 W, 1.92 W, 0.2048 W, 0.1792 W, −3.072 W.
■ FIGURE 3.14 A simple loop circuit.
In the preceding example and practice problem, we were asked to compute
the power absorbed by each element of a circuit. It is difficult to think of a
situation, however, in which all of the absorbed power quantities of a circuit
would be positive, for the simple reason that the energy must come from
somewhere. Thus, from simple conservation of energy, we expect that the
sum of the absorbed power for each element of a circuit should be zero. In49
SECTION 3.5 THE SINGLE-NODE-PAIR CIRCUIT
other words, at least one of the quantities should be negative (neglecting the
trivial case where the circuit is not operating). Stated another way, the sum
of the supplied power for each element should be zero. More pragmatically,
the sum of the absorbed power equals the sum of the supplied power,
which seems reasonable enough at face value.
Let’s test this with the circuit of Fig. 3.13 from Example 3.5, which
consists of two sources (one dependent and one independent) and two
resistors. Adding the power absorbed by each element, we find
p absorbed = −960 + 1920 − 1920 + 960 = 0
all elements
In reality (our indication is the sign associated with the absorbed power)
the 120 V source supplies +960 W, and the dependent source supplies
+1920 W. Thus, the sources supply a total of 960 + 1920 = 2880 W. The
resistors are expected to absorb positive power, which in this case sums to a
total of 1920 + 960 = 2880 W. Thus, if we take into account each element
of the circuit,
p absorbed =
p supplied
as we expect.
Turning our attention to Practice Problem 3.6, the solution to which
the reader might want to verify, we see that the absorbed powers sum
to 0.768 + 1.92 + 0.2048 + 0.1792 − 3.072 = 0. Interestingly enough, the
12 V independent voltage source is absorbing +1.92 W, which means it is
dissipating power, not supplying it. Instead, the dependent voltage source
appears to be supplying all the power in this particular circuit. Is such a
thing possible? We usually expect a source to supply positive power, but
since we are employing idealized sources in our circuits, it is in fact possi-
ble to have a net power flow into any source. If the circuit is changed in
some way, the same source might then be found to supply positive power.
The result is not known until a circuit analysis has been completed.

THE SINGLE-NODE-PAIR CIRCUIT
The companion of the single-loop circuit discussed in Sec. 3.4 is the single-
node-pair circuit, in which any number of simple elements are connected
between the same pair of nodes. An example of such a circuit is shown in
Fig. 3.15a. KVL forces us to recognize that the voltage across each branch
is the same as that across any other branch. Elements in a circuit having a
common voltage across them are said to be connected in parallel.
EXAMPLE 3.6
Find the voltage, current, and power associated with each element
in the circuit of Fig. 3.15a.
We first define a voltage v and arbitrarily select its polarity as shown in
Fig. 3.15b. Two currents, flowing in the resistors, are selected in con-
formance with the passive sign convention, as shown in Fig. 3.15b.

Determining either current i 1 or i 2 will enable us to obtain a value
for v. Thus, our next step is to apply KCL to either of the two nodes in
the circuit. Equating the algebraic sum of the currents leaving the upper
node to zero:
−120 + i 1 + 30 + i 2 = 0
Writing both currents in terms of the voltage v using Ohm’s law
i 1 = 30v
and i 2 = 15v
we obtain
−120 + 30v + 30 + 15v = 0
Solving this equation for v results in
v = 2V
and invoking Ohm’s law then gives
i 1 = 60 A and i 2 = 30 A
The absorbed power in each element can now be computed. In the
two resistors,
p R1 = 30(2) 2 = 120 W and
p R2 = 15(2) 2 = 60 W
and for the two sources,
p 120A = 120(−2) = −240 W and
p 30A = 30(2) = 60 W
Since the 120 A source absorbs negative 240 W, it is actually supplying
power to the other elements in the circuit. In a similar fashion, we find
that the 30 A source is actually absorbing power rather than supplying it.

SERIES AND PARALLEL CONNECTED SOURCES
It turns out that some of the equation writing that we have been doing for
series and parallel circuits can be avoided by combining sources. Note,
however, that all the current, voltage, and power relationships in the
remainder of the circuit will be unchanged. For example, several voltage52

sources in series may be replaced by an equivalent voltage source having a
voltage equal to the algebraic sum of the individual sources (Fig. 3.19a).
Parallel current sources may also be combined by algebraically adding the
individual currents, and the order of the parallel elements may be rearranged
as desired (Fig. 3.19b).
EXAMPLE 3.8
Determine the current i in the circuit of Fig. 3.20a by first combin
ing the sources into a single equivalent voltage source.
To be able to combine the voltage sources, they must be in series. Since
the same current (i) flows through each, this condition is satisfied.
Starting from the bottom left-hand corner and proceeding clockwise,
−3 − 9 − 5 + 1 = −16 V
so we may replace the four voltage sources with a single 16 V source
having its negative reference as shown in Fig. 3.20b.
KVL combined with Ohm’s law then yields
−16 + 100i + 220i = 0
or
i =

To conclude the discussion of parallel and series source combinations,
we should consider the parallel combination of two voltage sources and the
series combination of two current sources. For instance, what is the equiva-
lent of a 5 V source in parallel with a 10 V source? By the definition of a
voltage source, the voltage across the source cannot change; by Kirchhoff’s
voltage law, then, 5 equals 10 and we have hypothesized a physical impos-
sibility. Thus, ideal voltage sources in parallel are permissible only when
each has the same terminal voltage at every instant. In a similar way, two
current sources may not be placed in series unless each has the same cur-
rent, including sign, for every instant of time.
EXAMPLE 3.10
Determine which of the circuits of Fig. 3.24 are valid.
The circuit of Fig. 3.24a consists of two voltage sources in parallel. The
value of each source is different, so this circuit violates KVL. For exam-
ple, if a resistor is placed in parallel with the 5 V source, it is also in paral-
lel with the 10 V source. The actual voltage across it is therefore ambigu-
ous, and clearly the circuit cannot be constructed as indicated. If we
attempt to build such a circuit in real life, we will find it impossible to
locate “ideal” voltage sources—all real-world sources have an internal
resistance. The presence of such resistance allows a voltage difference
between the two real sources. Along these lines, the circuit of Fig. 3.24b
is perfectly valid.

RESISTORS IN SERIES AND PARALLEL
It is often possible to replace relatively complicated resistor combinations
with a single equivalent resistor. This is useful when we are not specifically
interested in the current, voltage, or power associated with any of the indi-
vidual resistors in the combinations. All the current, voltage, and power rela-
tionships in the remainder of the circuit will be unchanged.
Consider the series combination of N resistors shown in Fig. 3.26a. We
want to simplify the circuit with replacing the N resistors with a single resistor
R eq so that the remainder of the circuit, in this case only the voltage source,
does not realize that any change has been made. The current, voltage, and
power of the source must be the same before and after the replacement.
First, apply KVL:
v s = v 1 + v 2 + · · · + v N
and then Ohm’s law:
v s = R 1 i + R 2 i + · · · + R N i = (R 1 + R 2 + · · · + R N )i
Now compare this result with the simple equation applying to the equiv-
alent circuit shown in Fig. 3.26b:
v s = R eq i

Helpful Tip: Inspection of the KVL equation for any
series circuit will show that the order in which elements
are placed in such a circuit makes no difference.56
CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS
Thus, the value of the equivalent resistance for N series resistors is
R eq = R 1 + R 2 + · · · + R N
[8]
We are therefore able to replace a two-terminal network consisting of N
series resistors with a single two-terminal element R eq that has the same
v-i relationship.
It should be emphasized again that we might be interested in the current,
voltage, or power of one of the original elements. For example, the voltage
of a dependent voltage source may depend upon the voltage across R 3 .
Once R 3 is combined with several series resistors to form an equivalent re-
sistance, then it is gone and the voltage across it cannot be determined until
R 3 is identified by removing it from the combination. In that case, it would
have been better to look ahead and not make R 3 a part of the combination
initially.
EXAMPLE 3.11
Use resistance and source combinations to determine the current i
in Fig. 3.27a and the power delivered by the 80 V source.

next step is to then combine the three voltage sources into an equivalent
90 V source, and the four resistors into an equivalent 30 resistance,
as in Fig. 3.27c. Thus, instead of writing
−80 + 10i − 30 + 7i + 5i + 20 + 8i = 0
we have simply
−90 + 30i = 0
and so we find that
i = 3A
In order to calculate the power delivered to the circuit by the 80 V
source appearing in the given circuit, it is necessary to return to
Fig. 3.27a with the knowledge that the current is 3 A. The desired
power is then 80 V × 3 A
240 W.
It is interesting to note that no element of the original circuit remains

a 2 A source.
The two 6 resistors are in parallel and can be replaced with a
single 3 resistor in series with the 15 resistor. Thus, the two 6
resistors and the 15 resistor are replaced by an 18 resistor
(Fig. 3.31b).
No matter how tempting, we should not combine the remaining three
resistors; the controlling variable i 3 depends on the 3 resistor and so
that resistor must remain untouched. The only further simplification,
18 = 6 , as shown in Fig. 3.31c.
then, is 9

CHAPTER 3 VOLTAGE AND CURRENT LAWS
Applying KCL at the top node of Fig. 3.31c, we have

Employing Ohm’s law,
v = 3i 3
which allows us to compute
i 3 =

A

Thus, the voltage across the dependent source (which is the same as
the voltage across the 3 resistor) is
v = 3i 3 = 10 V
The dependent source therefore furnishes v × 0.9i 3 =
10(0.9)(10/3) = 30 W to the remainder of the circuit.
Now if we are later asked for the power dissipated in the 15 resis-
tor, we must return to the original circuit. This resistor is in series with
an equivalent 3 resistor; a voltage of 10 V is across the 18 total;
therefore, a current of 5/9 A flows through the 15 resistor and the
power absorbed by this element is (5/9) 2 (15) or 4.63 W.

Three final comments on series and parallel combinations might be
helpful. The first is illustrated by referring to Fig. 3.33a and asking, “Are v s
and R in series or in parallel?” The answer is “Both.” The two elements
carry the same current and are therefore in series; they also enjoy the same
voltage and consequently are in parallel.
The second comment is a word of caution. Circuits can be drawn in such
a way as to make series or parallel combinations difficult to spot. In
Fig. 3.33b, for example, the only two resistors in parallel are R 2 and R 3 ,
while the only two in series are R 1 and R 8 .
The final comment is simply that a simple circuit element need not be in
series or parallel with any other simple circuit element in a circuit. For exam-
ple, R 4 and R 5 in Fig. 3.33b are not in series or parallel with any other simple
circuit element, and there are no simple circuit elements in Fig. 3.33c that
are in series or parallel with any other simple circuit element. In other words,
we cannot simplify that circuit further using any of the techniques discussed
in this chapter.

VOLTAGE AND CURRENT DIVISION
By combining resistances and sources, we have found one method of short-
ening the work of analyzing a circuit. Another useful shortcut is the appli-
cation of the ideas of voltage and current division. Voltage division is used
to express the voltage across one of several series resistors in terms of the

voltage across the combination. In Fig. 3.34, the voltage across R 2 is found
via KVL and Ohm’s law:

and the voltage across R 1 is, similarly,

If the network of Fig. 3.34 is generalized by removing R 2 and replacing
it with the series combination of R 2 , R 3 , . . . , R N , then we have the general
result for voltage division across a string of N series resistors
v k =
R k
v
R 1 + R 2 + · · · + R N
[11]
which allows us to compute the voltage v k that appears across an arbitrary
resistor R k of the series.

Since v x appears across the parallel combination, our simplification
has not lost this quantity. However, further simplification of the circuit
by replacing the series combination of the 4 resistor with our new
2 resistor would.63

Fig. 3.37.

Nature has not smiled on us here, for these last two equations have a
factor which differs subtly from the factor used with voltage division, and
some effort is going to be needed to avoid errors. Many students look on the
expression for voltage division as “obvious” and that for current division as
being “different.” It helps to realize that the larger of two parallel resistors
always carries the smaller current.

Unfortunately, current division is sometimes applied when it is not
applicable. As one example, let us consider again the circuit shown in
Fig. 3.33c, a circuit that we have already agreed contains no circuit ele-
ments that are in series or in parallel. Without parallel resistors, there is no
way that current division can be applied. Even so, there are too many stu-
dents who take a quick look at resistors R A and R B and try to apply current
division, writing an incorrect equation such as
i A = i S
R B
R A + R B
Remember, parallel resistors must be branches between the same pair of
nodes.

Not the Earth Ground from Geology
Up to now, we have been drawing circuit schematics in a
fashion similar to that of the one shown in Fig. 3.40,
where voltages are defined across two clearly marked
terminals. Special care was taken to emphasize the fact
that voltage cannot be defined at a single point—it is by
definition the difference in potential between two points.
However, many schematics make use of the convention
of taking the earth as defining zero volts, so that all other
voltages are implicitly referenced to this potential. The
concept is often referred to as earth ground, and is fun-
damentally tied to safety regulations designed to prevent
fires, fatal electrical shocks, and related mayhem. The
symbol for earth ground is shown in Fig. 3.41a.
Since earth ground is defined as zero volts, it is often
convenient to use this as a common terminal in schemat-
ics. The circuit of Fig. 3.40 is shown redrawn in this
fashion in Fig. 3.42, where the earth ground symbol rep-
resents a common node. It is important to note that the
two circuits are equivalent in terms of our value for v a
(4.5 V in either case), but are no longer exactly the same.
The circuit in Fig. 3.40 is said to be “floating” in that it
could for all practical purposes be installed on a circuit
board of a satellite in geosynchronous orbit (or on its
way to Pluto). The circuit in Fig. 3.42, however, is some-
how physically connected to the ground through a
conducting path. For this reason, there are two other
symbols that are occasionally used to denote a common
terminal. Figure 3.41b shows what is commonly referred
to as signal ground; there can be (and often is) a large
voltage between earth ground and any terminal tied to
signal ground.
The fact that the common terminal of a circuit may or
may not be connected by some low-resistance pathway
to earth ground can lead to potentially dangerous situa-
tions. Consider the diagram of Fig. 3.43a, which depicts
an innocent bystander about to touch a piece of equip-
ment powered by an ac outlet. Only two terminals have
been used from the wall socket; the round ground pin
of the receptacle was left unconnected. The common
terminal of every circuit in the equipment has been tied
together and electrically connected to the conducting
equipment chassis; this terminal is often denoted using
the chassis ground symbol of Fig. 3.41c. Unfortunately,
a wiring fault exists, due to either poor manufacturing or
perhaps just wear and tear. At any rate, the chassis is not
“grounded,” so there is a very large resistance between
chassis ground and earth ground. A pseudo-schematic
(some liberty was taken with the person’s equivalent re-
sistance symbol) of the situation is shown in Fig. 3.43b.
The electrical path between the conducting chassis and
ground may in fact be the table, which could represent a
resistance of hundreds of megaohms or more. The resis-
tance of the person, however, is many orders of magni-
tude lower. Once the person taps on the equipment to see
why it isn’t working properly . . . well, let’s just say not
all stories have happy endings.
The fact that “ground” is not always “earth ground”
can cause a wide range of safety and electrical noise
problems. One example is occasionally encountered in
older buildings, where plumbing originally consisted of
electrically conducting copper pipes. In such buildings,
any water pipe was often treated as a low-resistance
path to earth ground, and therefore used in many
electrical connections. However, when corroded pipes
are replaced with more modern and cost-effective

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
We began this chapter by discussing connections of circuit elements, and
introducing the terms node, path, loop, and branch. The next two topics
could be considered the two most important in the entire textbook, namely,
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law. The first is
derived from conservation of charge, and can be thought of in terms of
“what goes in (current) must come out.” The second is based on
conservation of energy, and can be viewed as “what goes up (potential)
must come down.” These two laws allow us to analyze any circuit, linear or
otherwise, provided we have a way of relating the voltage and current
associated with passive elements (e.g., Ohm’s law for the resistor). In the
case of a single-loop circuit, the elements are connected in series and hence
each carries the same current. The single-node-pair circuit, in which
elements are connected in parallel with one another, is characterized by a
single voltage common to each element. Extending these concepts allowed
us to develop a means of simplifying voltage sources connected in series, or
current sources in parallel; subsequently we obtained classic expressions
for series and parallel connected resistors. The final topic, that of voltage
and current division, finds considerable use in the design of circuits where a
specific voltage or current is required but our choice of source is limited.
Let’s conclude with key points of this chapter to review, highlighting
appropriate examples.67

Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of the
currents entering any node is zero. (Examples 3.1, 3.4)
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of the
voltages around any closed path in a circuit is zero. (Examples 3.2, 3.3)
All elements in a circuit that carry the same current are said to be
connected in series. (Example 3.5)
Elements in a circuit having a common voltage across them are said to
be connected in parallel. (Examples 3.6, 3.7)
Voltage sources in series can be replaced by a single source, provided
care is taken to note the individual polarity of each source.
(Examples 3.8, 3.10)
Current sources in parallel can be replaced by a single source,
provided care is taken to note the direction of each current arrow.
(Examples 3.9, 3.10)
A series combination of N resistors can be replaced by a single resistor
having the value R eq = R 1 + R 2 + · · · + R N . (Example 3.11)

Voltage division allows us to calculate what fraction of the total
voltage across a series string of resistors is dropped across any one
resistor (or group of resistors). (Example 3.13)
Current division allows us to calculate what fraction of the total current
into a parallel string of resistors flows through any one of the resistors.

24. The circuit shown in Fig. 3.64 includes a device known as an op amp. This
device has two unusual properties in the circuit shown: (1) V d = 0 V, and
(2) no current can flow into either input terminal (marked “−” and “+” inside
the symbol), but it can flow through the output terminal (marked “OUT”).
This seemingly impossible situation—in direct conflict with KCL—is a result
of power leads to the device that are not included in the symbol. Based on this
information, calculate V out . (Hint: two KVL equations are required, both
involving the 5 V source.)

INTRODUCTION
Armed with the trio of Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, analyzing
a simple linear circuit to obtain useful information such as the
current, voltage, or power associated with a particular element is
perhaps starting to seem a straightforward enough venture. Still,
for the moment at least, every circuit seems unique, requiring (to
some degree) a measure of creativity in approaching the analysis.
In this chapter, we learn two basic circuit analysis techniques—
nodal analysis and mesh analysis—both of which allow us to
investigate many different circuits with a consistent, methodical
approach. The result is a streamlined analysis, a more uniform
level of complexity in our equations, fewer errors and, perhaps
most importantly, a reduced occurrence of “I don’t know how
to even start!”
Most of the circuits we have seen up to now have been rather
simple and (to be honest) of questionable practical use. Such
circuits are valuable, however, in helping us to learn to apply
fundamental techniques. Although the more complex circuits
appearing in this chapter may represent a variety of electrical
systems including control circuits, communication networks,
motors, or integrated circuits, as well as electric circuit models
of nonelectrical systems, we believe it best not to dwell on such
specifics at this early stage. Rather, it is important to initially focus
on the methodology of problem solving that we will continue to
develop throughout the book.

CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS
4.1
•
NODAL ANALYSIS
We begin our study of general methods for methodical circuit analysis by
considering a powerful method based on KCL, namely nodal analysis. In
Chap. 3 we considered the analysis of a simple circuit containing only two
nodes. We found that the major step of the analysis was obtaining a single
equation in terms of a single unknown quantity—the voltage between the
pair of nodes.
We will now let the number of nodes increase and correspondingly pro-
vide one additional unknown quantity and one additional equation for each
added node. Thus, a three-node circuit should have two unknown voltages
and two equations; a 10-node circuit will have nine unknown voltages and
nine equations; an N-node circuit will need (N − 1) voltages and (N − 1)
equations. Each equation is a simple KCL equation.
To illustrate the basic technique, consider the three-node circuit shown
in Fig. 4.1a, redrawn in Fig. 4.1b to emphasize the fact that there are only
three nodes, numbered accordingly. Our goal will be to determine the volt-
age across each element, and the next step in the analysis is critical. We des-
ignate one node as a reference node; it will be the negative terminal of our
N − 1 = 2 nodal voltages, as shown in Fig. 4.1c.
A little simplification in the resultant equations is obtained if the node
connected to the greatest number of branches is identified as the reference
node. If there is a ground node, it is usually most convenient to select it as
the reference node, although many people seem to prefer selecting the bot-
tom node of a circuit as the reference, especially if no explicit ground is
noted.
The voltage of node 1 relative to the reference node is named v 1 , and v 2
is defined as the voltage of node 2 with respect to the reference node. These

two voltages are all we need, as the voltage between any other pair of nodes
may be found in terms of them. For example, the voltage of node 1 with
respect to node 2 is v 1 − v 2 . The voltages v 1 and v 2 and their reference signs
are shown in Fig. 4.1c. It is common practice once a reference node has
been labeled to omit the reference signs for the sake of clarity; the node
labeled with the voltage is taken to be the positive terminal (Fig. 4.1d). This
is understood to be a type of shorthand voltage notation.
We now apply KCL to nodes 1 and 2. We do this by equating the total
current leaving the node through the several resistors to the total source
current entering the node. Thus,
v 1
v 1 − v 2
+
= 3.1

= −(−1.4)

5 [3]
−0.2v 1 + 1.2v 2 = 1.4 [4]
or
At node 2 we obtain
or
Equations [2] and [4] are the desired two equations in two unknowns, and
they may be solved easily. The results are v 1 = 5 V and v 2 = 2 V.
From this, it is straightforward to determine the voltage across the 5
resistor: v 5 = v 1 − v 2 = 3 V. The currents and absorbed powers may also
be computed in one step.
We should note at this point that there is more than one way to write the
KCL equations for nodal analysis. For example, the reader may prefer to
sum all the currents entering a given node and set this quantity to zero.
Thus, for node 1 we might have written
3.1 −
v 1 − v 2
v 1
−
= 0
2
5
or
3.1 +
v 2 − v 1
−v 1
+
= 0

either of which is equivalent to Eq. [1].
Is one way better than any other? Every instructor and every student
develop a personal preference, and at the end of the day the most important
thing is to be consistent. The authors prefer constructing KCL equations for
nodal analysis in such a way as to end up with all current source terms on
one side and all resistor terms on the other. Specifically,
currents entering the node from current sources
=
currents leaving the node through resistors
There are several advantages to such an approach. First, there is never any
confusion regarding whether a term should be “v 1 − v 2 ” or “v 2 − v 1 ;” the
81
The reference node in a schematic is implicitly defined
as zero volts. However, it is important to remember
that any terminal can be designated as the reference
terminal. Thus, the reference node is at zero volts with
respect to the other defined nodal voltages, and not
necessarily with respect to earth ground.82
CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS
first voltage in every resistor current expression corresponds to the node for
which a KCL equation is being written, as seen in Eqs. [1] and [3]. Second,
it allows a quick check that a term has not been accidentally omitted. Sim-
ply count the current sources connected to a node and then the resistors;
grouping them in the stated fashion makes the comparison a little easier.

Nodal analysis will directly yield numerical values for the nodal volt-
ages v 1 and v 2 , and the desired current is given by i = (v 1 − v 2 )/15.
Before launching into nodal analysis, however, we first note that no
details regarding either the 7 resistor or the 3 resistor are of inter-
est. Thus, we may replace their series combination with a 10 resistor
as in Fig. 4.2b. The result is a reduction in the number of equations to
solve.

Solving, we find that v 1 = 20 V and v 2 = 20 V so that v 1 − v 2 = 0.
In other words, zero current is flowing through the 15 resistor in this
circuit!83

᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
Substituting the nodal voltages into any of our three nodal equations
is sufficient to ensure we made no computational errors. Beyond that,
is it possible to determine whether these voltages are “reasonable”
values? We have a maximum possible current of 3 + 8 + 25 = 36
amperes anywhere in the circuit. The largest resistor is 7 , so we do
not expect any voltage magnitude greater than 7 × 36 = 252 V.
There are, of course, numerous methods available for the solution of
linear systems of equations, and we describe several in Appendix 2 in detail.
Prior to the advent of the scientific calculator, Cramer’s rule as seen in
Example 4.2 was very common in circuit analysis, although occasionally
tedious to implement. It is, however, straightforward to use on a simpleSECTION 4.1 NODAL ANALYSIS
four-function calculator, and so an awareness of the technique can be
valuable. MATLAB, on the other hand, although not likely to be available
during an examination, is a powerful software package that can greatly sim-
plify the solution process; a brief tutorial on getting started is provided in
Appendix 6.
For the situation encountered in Example 4.2, there are several options
available through MATLAB. First, we can represent Eqs. [7] to [9] in matrix
form:

In MATLAB, we write

where spaces separate elements along rows, and a semicolon separates
rows. The matrix named b, which can also be referred to as a vector as it has
only one column, is our solution. Thus, v 1 = 5.412 V, v 2 = 7.738 V, and
v 3 = 46.31 V (some rounding error has been incurred).

which results in exact answers, with no rounding errors. The solve() routine
is invoked with the list of symbolic equations we named eqn1, eqn2, and
eqn3, but the variables v1, v2 and v3 must also be specified. If solve() is
called with fewer variables than equations, an algebraic solution is returned.
The form of the solution is worth a quick comment; it is returned in what is
referred to in programming parlance as a structure; in this case, we called
our structure “answer.’’ Each component of the structure is accessed sepa-
rately by name as shown.

We choose the bottom node as our reference, since it has a large
number of branch connections, and proceed to label the nodal voltages
v 1 and v 2 as shown in Fig. 4.6b. The quantity labeled v x is actually
equal to v 2 .
At node 1, we write

Unfortunately, we have only two equations but three unknowns; this
is a direct result of the presence of the dependent current source, since
it is not controlled by a nodal voltage. Thus, we need an additional
equation that relates i 1 to one or more nodal voltages.
In this case, we find that
v 1
i 1 =

which upon substitution into Eq. [11] yields (with a little rearranging)
3v 1 − 2v 2 = 30 [13]
−15v 1 + 8v 2 = 0 [14]
and Eq. [10] simplifies to
Solving, we find that v 1 = −40 V, v 2 = −75 V, and i 1 = 0.5v 1 =
−20 A. Thus, the power supplied by the dependent source is equal to
(3i 1 )(v 2 ) = (−60)(−75) = 4.5 kW.
We see that the presence of a dependent source will create the need for
an additional equation in our analysis if the controlling quantity is not a
nodal voltage. Now let’s look at the same circuit, but with the controlling
variable of the dependent current source changed to a different quantity—
the voltage across the 3 resistor, which is in fact a nodal voltage. We will
find that only two equations are required to complete the analysis.
EXAMPLE 4.4
Determine the power supplied by the dependent source of Fig. 4.7a.
We select the bottom node as our reference and label the nodal voltages
as shown in Fig. 4.7b. We have labeled the nodal voltage v x explicitly

case; it led to the quantity v x being a nodal voltage.

SECTION 4.2 THE SUPERNODE
These seven basic steps will work on any circuit we ever encounter,
although the presence of voltage sources will require extra care. Such situ-
ations are discussed next.

•
THE SUPERNODE
As an example of how voltage sources are best handled when performing
nodal analysis, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.9a. The original four-
node circuit of Fig. 4.4 has been changed by replacing the 7 resistor be-
tween nodes 2 and 3 with a 22 V voltage source. We still assign the same
node-to-reference voltages v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 . Previously, the next step was the
application of KCL at each of the three nonreference nodes. If we try to do
that once again, we see that we will run into some difficulty at both nodes 2
and 3, for we do not know what the current is in the branch with the voltage
source. There is no way by which we can express the current as a function
of the voltage, for the definition of a voltage source is exactly that the volt-
age is independent of the current.
There are two ways out of this dilemma. The more difficult approach is to
assign an unknown current to the branch which contains the voltage source,
proceed to apply KCL three times, and then apply KVL (v 3 − v 2 = 22) once
between nodes 2 and 3; the result is then four equations in four unknowns.
The easier method is to treat node 2, node 3, and the voltage source to-
gether as a sort of supernode and apply KCL to both nodes at the same time;
the supernode is indicated by the region enclosed by the broken line in
Fig. 4.9a. This is okay because if the total current leaving node 2 is zero and
the total current leaving node 3 is zero, then the total current leaving the
combination of the two nodes is zero. This concept is represented graphi-
cally in the expanded view of Fig. 4.9b.

Ans: 5.375 V, 375 mV.
The presence of a voltage source thus reduces by 1 the number of
nonreference nodes at which we must apply KCL, regardless of whether the
voltage source extends between two nonreference nodes or is connected
between a node and the reference. We should be careful in analyzing circuits
such as that of Practice Problem 4.4. Since both ends of the resistor are part
of the supernode, there must technically be two corresponding current terms
in the KCL equation, but they cancel each other out. We can summarize the
supernode method as follows:

Count the number of nodes (N).
Designate a reference node. The number of terms in your nodal
equations can be minimized by selecting the node with the greatest
number of branches connected to it.
Label the nodal voltages (there are N − 1 of them).
If the circuit contains voltage sources, form a supernode about
each one. This is done by enclosing the source, its two terminals,
and any other elements connected between the two terminals
within a broken-line enclosure.
Write a KCL equation for each nonreference node and for
each supernode that does not contain the reference node. Sum
the currents flowing into a node/supernode from current sources
on one side of the equation. On the other side, sum the currents
flowing out of the node/supernode through resistors. Pay close
attention to “−” signs.
Relate the voltage across each voltage source to nodal voltages.
This is accomplished by simple application of KVL; one such
equation is needed for each supernode defined.
Express any additional unknowns (i.e., currents or voltages other
than nodal voltages) in terms of appropriate nodal voltages. This
situation can occur if dependent sources appear in our circuit.
Organize the equations. Group terms according to nodal voltages.
Solve the system of equations for the nodal voltages (there will
be N − 1 of them).91
SECTION 4.2 THE SUPERNODE
We see that we have added two additional steps from our general nodal
analysis procedure. In reality, however, application of the supernode tech-
nique to a circuit containing voltage sources not connected to the reference
node will result in a reduction in the number of KCL equations required.
With this in mind, let’s consider the circuit of Fig. 4.11, which contains all
four types of sources and has five nodes.
EXAMPLE 4.6
Determine the node-to-reference voltages in the circuit of Fig. 4.11.
After establishing a supernode about each voltage source, we see that
we need to write KCL equations only at node 2 and at the supernode
containing the dependent voltage source. By inspection, it is clear that
v 1 = −12 V.

Finally, we express the dependent current source in terms of the
assigned variables:
0.5v x = 0.5(v 2 − v 1 )
[24]
Five nodes requires four KCL equations in general nodal analysis,
but we have reduced this requirement to only two, as we formed two
separate supernodes. Each supernode required a KVL equation (Eq. [22]
and v 1 = −12, the latter written by inspection). Neither dependent
source was controlled by a nodal voltage, so two additional equations
were needed as a result.
With this done, we can now eliminate v x and v y to obtain a set of

MESH ANALYSIS
As we have seen, nodal analysis is a straightforward analysis technique when
only current sources are present, and voltage sources are easily accommo-
dated with the supernode concept. Still, nodal analysis is based on KCL, and
the reader might at some point wonder if there isn’t a similar approach based
on KVL. There is—it’s known as mesh analysis—and although only strictly
speaking applicable to what we will shortly define as a planar circuit, it can in
many cases prove simpler to apply than nodal analysis.
If it is possible to draw the diagram of a circuit on a plane surface in such
a way that no branch passes over or under any other branch, then that circuit
is said to be a planar circuit. Thus, Fig. 4.13a shows a planar network,
Fig. 4.13b shows a nonplanar network, and Fig. 4.13c also shows a planar
network, although it is drawn in such a way as to make it appear nonplanar
at first glance.

■ FIGURE 4.13 Examples of planar and nonplanar networks; crossed wires without a solid dot are not
in physical contact with each other.
We should mention that mesh-type analysis can be
applied to nonplanar circuits, but since it is not possible
to define a complete set of unique meshes for such
circuits, assignment of unique mesh currents is not
possible.
In Sec. 3.1, the terms path, closed path, and loop were defined. Before
we define a mesh, let us consider the sets of branches drawn with heavy
lines in Fig. 4.14. The first set of branches is not a path, since four branches
are connected to the center node, and it is of course also not a loop. The sec-
ond set of branches does not constitute a path, since it is traversed only by
passing through the central node twice. The remaining four paths are all
loops. The circuit contains 11 branches.
The mesh is a property of a planar circuit and is undefined for a nonpla-
nar circuit. We define a mesh as a loop that does not contain any other loops
within it. Thus, the loops indicated in Fig. 4.14c and d are not meshes,
whereas those of parts e and f are meshes. Once a circuit has been drawn
neatly in planar form, it often has the appearance of a multipaned window;
the boundary of each pane in the window may be considered to be a mesh.
If a network is planar, mesh analysis can be used to accomplish the
analysis. This technique involves the concept of a mesh current, which we
introduce by considering the analysis of the two-mesh circuit of Fig. 4.15a.
As we did in the single-loop circuit, we will begin by defining a current
through one of the branches. Let us call the current flowing to the right
through the 6
resistor i 1 . We will apply KVL around each of the two
meshes, and the two resulting equations are sufficient to determine two un-
known currents. We next define a second current i 2 flowing to the right in93

the 4 resistor. We might also choose to call the current flowing downward
through the central branch i 3 , but it is evident from KCL that i 3 may be ex-
pressed in terms of the two previously assumed currents as (i 1 − i 2 ). The
assumed currents are shown in Fig. 4.15b.

If our circuit contains M meshes, then we expect to have M mesh cur-
rents and therefore will be required to write M independent equations.
Now let us consider this same problem in a slightly different manner by
using mesh currents. We define a mesh current as a current that flows only
around the perimeter of a mesh. One of the greatest advantages in the use of
mesh currents is the fact that Kirchhoff's current law is automatically satis-
fied. If a mesh current flows into a given node, it flows out of it also.

■ FIGURE 4.16 The same circuit considered in
Fig. 4.15b, but viewed a slightly different way.
A mesh current may often be identified as a branch
current, as i 1 and i 2 have been identified in this
example. This is not always true, however, for consider-
ation of a square nine-mesh network soon shows that
the central mesh current cannot be identified as the
current in any branch.
If we call the left-hand mesh of our problem mesh 1, then we may es-
tablish a mesh current i 1 flowing in a clockwise direction about this mesh.
A mesh current is indicated by a curved arrow that almost closes on itself
and is drawn inside the appropriate mesh, as shown in Fig. 4.16. The mesh
current i 2 is established in the remaining mesh, again in a clockwise direc-
tion. Although the directions are arbitrary, we will always choose clockwise
mesh currents because a certain error-minimizing symmetry then results in
the equations.
We no longer have a current or current arrow shown directly on each
branch in the circuit. The current through any branch must be determined by
considering the mesh currents flowing in every mesh in which that branch
appears. This is not difficult, because no branch can appear in more than two
meshes. For example, the 3 resistor appears in both meshes, and the cur-
rent flowing downward through it is i 1 − i 2 . The 6 resistor appears only
in mesh 1, and the current flowing to the right in that branch is equal to the
mesh current i 1 .
For the left-hand mesh,
−42 + 6i 1 + 3(i 1 − i 2 ) = 0
while for the right-hand mesh,
3(i 2 − i 1 ) + 4i 2 − 10 = 0
and these two equations are equivalent to Eqs. [25] and [26].

The previous examples dealt with circuits powered exclusively by inde-
pendent voltage sources. If a current source is included in the circuit, it may
either simplify or complicate the analysis, as discussed in Sec. 4.4. As seen
in our study of the nodal analysis technique, dependent sources generally
require an additional equation besides the M mesh equations, unless the
controlling variable is a mesh current (or sum of mesh currents). We explore
this in the following example.

Since the dependent source of Fig. 4.21 is controlled by a mesh current

two-mesh circuit. In the following example, we explore the situation that
arises if the controlling variable is not a mesh current.97

Since the dependent source is controlled by the unknown voltage
v x , we are faced with two equations in three unknowns. The way out of
our dilemma is to construct an equation for v x in terms of mesh cur-
rents, such as
v x = 4(i 2 − i 1 )
[31]
We simplify our system of equations by substituting Eq. [31] into
Eq. [29], resulting in
4i 1 = 5
Solving, we find that i 1 = 1.25 A. In this particular instance, Eq. [30]
is not needed unless a value for i 2 is desired.

Summary of Basic Mesh Analysis Procedure
1. Determine if the circuit is a planar circuit. If not, perform nodal
analysis instead.
2. Count the number of meshes (M). Redraw the circuit if
necessary.
3. Label each of the M mesh currents. Generally, defining all mesh
currents to flow clockwise results in a simpler analysis.
4. Write a KVL equation around each mesh. Begin with a conve-
nient node and proceed in the direction of the mesh current. Pay
close attention to “−” signs. If a current source lies on the periph-
ery of a mesh, no KVL equation is needed and the mesh current is
determined by inspection.
5. Express any additional unknowns such as voltages or currents
other than mesh currents in terms of appropriate mesh cur-
rents. This situation can occur if current sources or dependent
sources appear in our circuit.
6. Organize the equations. Group terms according to mesh currents.
7. Solve the system of equations for the mesh currents (there will
be M of them).

THE SUPERMESH
How must we modify this straightforward procedure when a current source
is present in the network? Taking our lead from nodal analysis, we should
feel that there are two possible methods. First, we could assign an unknown
voltage across the current source, apply KVL around each mesh as before,
and then relate the source current to the assigned mesh currents. This is gen-
erally the more difficult approach.
A better technique is one that is quite similar to the supernode approach
in nodal analysis. There we formed a supernode, completely enclosing
the voltage source inside the supernode and reducing the number of non-
reference nodes by 1 for each voltage source. Now we create a kind of
“supermesh” from two meshes that have a current source as a common
element; the current source is in the interior of the supermesh. We thus
reduce the number of meshes by 1 for each current source present. If the
current source lies on the perimeter of the circuit, then the single mesh in
which it is found is ignored. Kirchhoff’s voltage law is thus applied only to
those meshes or supermeshes in the reinterpreted network.
EXAMPLE 4.11
Determine the three mesh currents in Fig. 4.24a.
We note that a 7 A independent current source is in the common bound-
ary of two meshes, which leads us to create a supermesh whose interior99

The presence of one or more dependent sources merely requires each of
these source quantities and the variable on which it depends to be expressed
in terms of the assigned mesh currents. In Fig. 4.26, for example, we note
that both a dependent and an independent current source are included in the
network. Let’s see how their presence affects the analysis of the circuit and
actually simplifies it.

consideration—it is clear that i 1 = 15 A.
We find that because we now know one of the two mesh currents
relevant to the dependent current source, there is no need to write a
supermesh equation about meshes 1 and 3. Instead, we simply relate i 1
and i 3 to the current from the dependent source using KCL:

whether or not dependent sources, voltage sources, and/or current sources
are present, provided that the circuit can be drawn as a planar circuit:

sure helps when writing KVL equations.

on the periphery of a mesh, no KVL equation is needed and the
mesh current is determined by inspection.
Relate the current flowing f om each current source to mesh
currents. This is accomplished by simple application of KCL;
one such equation is needed for each supermesh defined.
Express any additional unknowns such as voltages or currents
other than mesh currents in terms of appropriate mesh cur-
rents. This situation can occur if dependent sources appear in
our circuit.
Organize the equations. Group terms according to nodal voltages.
Solve the system of equations for the mesh currents (there will

•
NODAL VS. MESH ANALYSIS: A COMPARISON
Now that we have examined two distinctly different approaches to circuit
analysis, it seems logical to ask if there is ever any advantage to using one
over the other. If the circuit is nonplanar, then there is no choice: only nodal
analysis may be applied.
Provided that we are indeed considering the analysis of a planar circuit,
however, there are situations where one technique has a small advantage
over the other. If we plan to use nodal analysis, then a circuit with N nodes
will lead to at most (N − 1) KCL equations. Each supernode defined will
further reduce this number by 1. If the same circuit has M distinct meshes,
then we will obtain at most M KVL equations; each supermesh will reduce
this number by 1. Based on these facts, we should select the approach that
will result in the smaller number of simultaneous equations.
If one or more dependent sources are included in the circuit, then each
controlling quantity may influence our choice of nodal or mesh analysis.
For example, a dependent voltage source controlled by a nodal voltage does
not require an additional equation when we perform nodal analysis. Like-
wise, a dependent current source controlled by a mesh current does not re-
quire an additional equation when we perform mesh analysis. What about
the situation where a dependent voltage source is controlled by a current?
Or the converse, where a dependent current source is controlled by a volt-
age? Provided that the controlling quantity can be easily related to mesh
currents, we might expect mesh analysis to be the more straightforward
option. Likewise, if the controlling quantity can be easily related to nodal
voltages, nodal analysis may be preferable. One final point in this regard is
to keep in mind the location of the source; current sources which lie on the
periphery of a mesh, whether dependent or independent, are easily treated
in mesh analysis; voltage sources connected to the reference terminal are
easily treated in nodal analysis.
When either method results in essentially the same number of equations,
it may be worthwhile to also consider what quantities are being sought.
Nodal analysis results in direct calculation of nodal voltages, whereas mesh
analysis provides currents. If we are asked to find currents through a set of
resistors, for example, after performing nodal analysis, we must still invoke
Ohm’s law at each resistor to determine the current.

COMPUTER-AIDED CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
We have seen that it does not take many components at all to create a cir-
cuit of respectable complexity. As we continue to examine even more
complex circuits, it will become obvious rather quickly that it is easy to
make errors during the analysis, and verifying solutions by hand can be
time-consuming. A powerful computer software package known as PSpice
is commonly employed for rapid analysis of circuits, and the schematic
capture tools are typically integrated with either a printed circuit board or
integrated circuit layout tool. Originally developed in the early 1970s at the
University of California at Berkeley, SPICE (Simulation Program with
Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is now an industry standard. MicroSim Cor-
poration introduced PSpice in 1984, which built intuitive graphical inter-
faces around the core SPICE program. Depending on the type of circuit
application being considered, there are now several companies offering
variations of the basic SPICE package.
Although computer-aided analysis is a relatively quick means of deter-
mining voltages and currents in a circuit, we should be careful not to allow
simulation packages to completely replace traditional “paper and pencil”
analysis. There are several reasons for this. First, in order to design we must
be able to analyze. Overreliance on software tools can inhibit the develop-
ment of necessary analytical skills, similar to introducing calculators too early
in grade school. Second, it is virtually impossible to use a complicated
software package over a long period of time without making some type of
data-entry error. If we have no basic intuition as to what type of answer to

expect from a simulation, then there is no way to determine whether or not
it is valid. Thus, the generic name really is a fairly accurate description:
computer-aided analysis. Human brains are not obsolete. Not yet, anyway.
As an example, consider the circuit of Fig. 4.15b, which includes two dc
voltage sources and three resistors. We wish to simulate this circuit using
PSpice so that we may determine the currents i 1 and i 2 . Figure 4.31a shows
the circuit as drawn using a schematic capture program. 1
(1) Refer to Appendix 4 for a brief tutorial on PSpice and schematic capture.SECTION 4.6 COMPUTER-AIDED CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
In order to determine the mesh currents, we need only run a bias point sim-
ulation. Under PSpice, select New Simulation Profile type in a name (such
as Example), and click on Create. Under the Analysis type: pull-down menu,
select Bias Point, then click on OK. Returning to the original schematic win-
dow, under PSpice select Run (or use either of the two shortcuts: pressing the
F11 key or clicking on the blue “Play” symbol). To see the currents calculated
by PSpice, make sure the current button is selected (Fig. 4.31b). The results of
our simulation are shown in Fig. 4.31c. We see that the two currents i 1 and i 2
are 6 A and 4 A, respectively, as we found previously.
As a further example, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 4.32a. It contains
a dc voltage source, a dc current source, and a voltage-controlled current
source. We are interested in the three nodal voltages, which from either nodal
or mesh analysis are found to be 82.91 V, 69.9 V, and 59.9 V, respectively, as
we move from left to right across the top of the circuit. Figure 4.32b shows
this circuit after the simulation was performed. The three nodal voltages are
indicated directly on the schematic. Note that in drawing a dependent source
using the schematic capture tool, we must explicitly link two terminals of
the source to the controlling voltage or current.

105PRACTICAL APPLICATION
Node-Based PSpice Schematic Creation
The most common method of describing a circuit in con-
junction with computer-aided circuit analysis is with
some type of graphical schematic drawing package, an
example output of which was shown in Fig. 4.32.
SPICE, however, was written before the advent of such
software, and as such requires circuits to be described in
a specific text-based format. The format has its roots in
the syntax used for punch cards, which gives it a some-
what distinct appearance. The basis for circuit de-
scription is the definition of elements, each terminal of
which is assigned a node number. So, although we have
just studied two different generalized circuit analysis
methods—the nodal and mesh techniques—it is interest-
ing that SPICE and PSpice were written using a clearly
defined nodal analysis approach.
Even though modern circuit analysis is largely done
using graphics-oriented interactive software, when errors
are generated (usually due to a mistake in drawing the
schematic or in selecting a combination of analysis op-
tions), the ability to read the text-based “input deck”
generated by the schematic capture tool can be invalu-
able in tracking down the specific problem. The easiest
way to develop such an ability is to learn how to run
PSpice directly from a user-written input deck.
Consider, for example, the sample input deck below
(lines beginning with an asterisk are comments, and are
skipped by SPICE).

We can create the input deck by using the Notepad pro-
gram from Windows or our favorite text editor. Saving the
file under the name example.cir, we next invoke PSpice
A/D (see Appendix. 4). Under File, we choose Open, lo-
cate the directory in which we saved our file example.cir,
and for Files of type: select Circuit Files (*.cir). After se-
lecting our file and clicking Open, we see the PSpice A/D
window with our circuit file loaded (Fig. 4.33a). A netlist
such as this, containing instructions for the simulation to be
performed, can be created by schematic capture software
or created manually as in this example.
We run the simulation by either clicking the green
“play” symbol at the top right, or selecting Run under
Simulation.
To view the results, we select Output File from un-
der the View menu, which provides the window shown
in Fig. 4.33b. Here it is worth noting that the output pro-
vides the expected nodal voltages (5 V at node 1, 2.5 V
across resistor R2), but the current is quoted using the
passive sign convention (i.e., Ϫ2.5 mA).
Text-based schematic entry is reasonably straightfor-
ward, but for complex (large number of elements) cir-
cuits, it can quickly become cumbersome. It is also easy
to misnumber nodes, an error that can be difficult to iso-
late. However, reading the input and output files is often
helpful when running simulations, so some experience
with this format is useful.
At this point, the real power of computer-aided analysis begins to be
apparent: Once you have the circuit drawn in the schematic capture program, it
is easy to experiment by simply changing component values and observing the
effect on currents and voltages. To gain a little experience at this point, try sim-
ulating any of the circuits shown in previous examples and practice problems.(a)

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
Although Chap. 3 introduced KCL and KVL, both of which are sufficient to
enable us to analyze any circuit, a more methodical approach proves help-
ful in everyday situations. Thus, in this chapter we developed the nodal
analysis technique based on KCL, which results in a voltage at each node108
CHAPTER 4 BASIC NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS
(with respect to some designated “reference” node). We generally need to
solve a system of simultaneous equations, unless voltage sources are con-
nected so that they automatically provide nodal voltages. The controlling
quantity of a dependent source is written down just as we would write down
the numerical value of an “independent” source. Typically an additional
equation is then required, unless the dependent source is controlled by a
nodal voltage. When a voltage source bridges two nodes, the basic tech-
nique can be extended by creating a supernode; KCL dictates that the sum
of the currents flowing into a group of connections so defined is equal to the
sum of the currents flowing out.
As an alternative to nodal analysis, the mesh analysis technique was de-
veloped through application of KVL; it yields the complete set of mesh cur-
rents, which do not always represent the net current flowing through any
particular element (for example, if an element is shared by two meshes).
The presence of a current source will simplify the analysis if it lies on the
periphery of a mesh; if the source is shared, then the supermesh technique
is best. In that case, we write a KVL equation around a path that avoids
the shared current source, then algebraically link the two corresponding
mesh currents using the source.
A common question is: “Which analysis technique should I use?” We dis-
cussed some of the issues that might go into choosing a technique for a given
circuit. These included whether or not the circuit is planar, what types of
sources are present and how they are connected, and also what specific infor-
mation is required (i.e., a voltage, current, or power). For complex circuits, it
may take a greater effort than it is worth to determine the “optimum” approach,
in which case most people will opt for the method with which they feel most
comfortable. We concluded the chapter by introducing PSpice, a common cir-
cuit simulation tool, which is very useful for checking our results.
At this point we wrap up by identifying key points of this chapter to re-
view, along with relevant example(s).
❑ Start each analysis with a neat, simple circuit diagram. Indicate all
element and source values. (Example 4.1)
❑ For nodal analysis,
❑ Choose one node as the reference node. Then label the node
voltages v 1 , v 2 , . . . , v N −1 . Each is understood to be measured with
respect to the reference node. (Examples 4.1, 4.2)
❑ If the circuit contains only current sources, apply KCL at each
nonreference node. (Examples 4.1, 4.2)
❑ If the circuit contains voltage sources, form a supernode about each
one, and then apply KCL at all nonreference nodes and supernodes.
(Examples 4.5, 4.6)
❑ For mesh analysis, first make certain that the network is a planar network.
❑ Assign a clockwise mesh current in each mesh: i 1 , i 2 , . . . , i M .
(Example 4.7)
❑ If the circuit contains only voltage sources, apply KVL around
each mesh. (Examples 4.7, 4.8, 4.9)
❑ If the circuit contains current sources, create a supermesh for each
one that is common to two meshes, and then apply KVL around
each mesh and supermesh. (Examples 4.11, 4.12)EXERCISES
❑

❑
Dependent sources will add an additional equation to nodal analysis
if the controlling variable is a current, but not if the controlling variable is
a nodal voltage. (Conversely, a dependent source will add an additional
equation to mesh analysis if the controlling variable is a voltage, but not
if the controlling variable is a mesh current). (Examples 4.3, 4.4, 4.6, 4.9,
4.10, 4.12)
In deciding whether to use nodal or mesh analysis for a planar circuit, a
circuit with fewer nodes/supernodes than meshes/supermeshes will
result in fewer equations using nodal analysis.
Computer-aided analysis is useful for checking results and analyzing
circuits with large numbers of elements. However, common sense must
be used to check simulation results.

KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
The techniques of nodal and mesh analysis described in Chap. 4
are reliable and extremely powerful methods. However, both
require that we develop a complete set of equations to describe
a particular circuit as a general rule, even if only one current,
voltage, or power quantity is of interest. In this chapter, we
investigate several different techniques for isolating specific parts
of a circuit in order to simplify the analysis. After examining each
of these techniques, we focus on how one might go about selecting
one method over another.
5.1 LINEARITY AND SUPERPOSITION
•
All of the circuits which we plan to analyze can be classified as lin-
ear circuits, so this is a good time to be more specific in defining
exactly what we mean by that. Having done this, we can then con-
sider the most important consequence of linearity, the principle of
superposition. This principle is very basic and will appear repeat-
edly in our study of linear circuit analysis. As a matter of fact, the
nonapplicability of superposition to nonlinear circuits is the very
reason they are so difficult to analyze!
The principle of superposition states that the response (a desired
current or voltage) in a linear circuit having more than one indepen-
dent source can be obtained by adding the responses caused by the
separate independent sources acting alone.

Linear Elements and Linear Circuits
We define a linear element as a passive element that has a linear
voltage-current relationship. By a “linear voltage-current relationship’’
123124
CHAPTER 5 HANDY CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
we simply mean that multiplication of the current through the element by a
constant K results in the multiplication of the voltage across the element by
the same constant K. At this time, only one passive element has been defined
(the resistor), and its voltage-current relationship
v(t) = Ri(t)
The dependent voltage source v s ϭ 0.6i 1 Ϫ 14v 2 is
linear, but v s ϭ 0.6i 12 and v s ϭ 0.6i 1 v 2 are not.
is clearly linear. As a matter of fact, if v(t) is plotted as a function of i(t),
the result is a straight line.
We define a linear dependent source as a dependent current or voltage
source whose output current or voltage is proportional only to the first
power of a specified current or voltage variable in the circuit (or to the sum
of such quantities).
We now define a linear circuit as a circuit composed entirely of inde-
pendent sources, linear dependent sources, and linear elements. From this
definition, it is possible to show 1 that “the response is proportional to the
source,’’ or that multiplication of all independent source voltages and cur-
rents by a constant K increases all the current and voltage responses by the
same factor K (including the dependent source voltage or current outputs).

■ FIGURE 5.1 A circuit with two independent current
sources.
The most important consequence of linearity is superposition.
Let us explore the superposition principle by considering first the circuit
of Fig. 5.1, which contains two independent sources, the current generators
that force the currents i a and i b into the circuit. Sources are often called forc-
ing functions for this reason, and the nodal voltages that they produce can be
termed response functions, or simply responses. Both the forcing functions
and the responses may be functions of time. The two nodal equations for this
circuit are
0.7v 1 − 0.2v 2 = i a [1]
−0.2v 1 + 1.2v 2 = i b [2]
Now let us perform experiment x. We change the two forcing functions
to i ax and i bx ; the two unknown voltages will now be different, so we will
call them v 1x and v 2x . Thus,
0.7v 1x − 0.2v 2x = i ax [3]
−0.2v 1x + 1.2v 2x = i bx [4]
We next perform experiment y by changing the source currents to i ay
and i by and measure the responses v 1y and v 2y :
0.7v 1y − 0.2v 2y = i ay [5]
−0.2v 1y + 1.2v 2y = i by [6]
(1) The proof involves first showing that the use of nodal analysis on the linear circuit can produce only
linear equations of the form
a 1 v 1 + a 2 v 2 + · · · + a N v N = b
where the a i are constants (combinations of resistance or conductance values, constants appearing in
dependent source expressions, 0, or ±1), the v i are the unknown node voltages (responses), and b is an
independent source value or a sum of independent source values. Given a set of such equations, if we
multiply all the b’s by K, then it is evident that the solution of this new set of equations will be the node
voltages Kv 1 , Kv 2 , . . . , Kv N .125
SECTION 5.1 LINEARITY AND SUPERPOSITION
These three sets of equations describe the same circuit with three differ-
ent sets of source currents. Let us add or “superpose’’ the last two sets of
equations. Adding Eqs. [3] and [5],
(0.7v 1x + 0.7v 1y ) − (0.2v 2x + 0.2v 2y ) = i ax + i ay

[2]
where Eq. [1] has been written immediately below Eq. [7] and Eq. [2] below
Eq. [8] for easy comparison.
The linearity of all these equations allows us to compare Eq. [7] with
Eq. [1] and Eq. [8] with Eq. [2] and draw an interesting conclusion. If we
select i ax and i ay such that their sum is i a and select i bx and i by such that their
sum is i b , then the desired responses v 1 and v 2 may be found by adding v 1x
to v 1y and v 2x to v 2y , respectively. In other words, we can perform experi-
ment x and note the responses, perform experiment y and note the
responses, and finally add the two sets of responses. This leads to the fun-
damental concept involved in the superposition principle: to look at each
independent source (and the response it generates) one at a time with the
other independent sources “turned off’’ or “zeroed out.’’
If we reduce a voltage source to zero volts, we have effectively created
a short circuit (Fig. 5.2a). If we reduce a current source to zero amps, we
have effectively created an open circuit (Fig. 5.2b). Thus, the superposition
theorem can be stated as:
In any linear resistive network, the voltage across or the current through any re-
sistor or source may be calculated by adding algebraically all the individual
voltages or currents caused by the separate independent sources acting alone,
with all other independent voltage sources replaced by short circuits and all
other independent current sources replaced by open circuits.
Thus, if there are N independent sources, we must perform N experi-
ments, each having only one of the independent sources active and the
others inactive/turned off/zeroed out. Note that dependent sources are in
general active in every experiment.
There is also no reason that an independent source must assume only its
given value or a zero value in the several experiments; it is necessary only
for the sum of the several values to be equal to the original value. An inac-
tive source almost always leads to the simplest circuit, however.
The circuit we have just used as an example should indicate that a much
stronger theorem might be written; a group of independent sources may be
made active and inactive collectively, if we wish. For example, suppose
there are three independent sources. The theorem states that we may find a
given response by considering each of the three sources acting alone and
adding the three results. Alternatively, we may find the response due to the
first and second sources operating with the third inactive, and then add to
this the response caused by the third source acting alone. This amounts to
treating several sources collectively as a sort of “supersource.”

i x is desired; (b) same circuit with current source open-circuited; (c) original circuit with voltage
source short-circuited.
First set the current source equal to zero and redraw the circuit
as shown in Fig. 5.3b. The portion of i x due to the voltage source
has been designated i x to avoid confusion and is easily found to be
0.2 A.
Next set the voltage source in Fig. 5.3a to zero and again redraw the
circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.3c. Current division lets us determine that i x
(the portion of i x due to the 2 A current source) is 0.8 A.
Now compute the total current i x by adding the two individual
components:
i x = i x| 3 V + i x| 2 A = i x + i x
or
i x =
3
6
+ 2
6 + 9
6 + 9
= 0.2 + 0.8 = 1.0 A
Another way of looking at Example 5.1 is that the 3 V source and the
2 A source are each performing work on the circuit, resulting in a total cur-
rent i x flowing through the 9 resistor. However, the contribution of the 3 V
source to i x does not depend on the contribution of the 2 A source, and vice
versa. For example, if we double the output of the 2 A source to 4 A, it will
now contribute 1.6 A to the total current i x flowing through the 9 resistor.
However, the 3 V source will still contribute only 0.2 A to i x , for a new total
current of 0.2 + 1.6 = 1.8 A.SECTION 5.1 LINEARITY AND SUPERPOSITION

As we will see, superposition does not generally reduce our workload
when considering a particular circuit, since it leads to the analysis of several
new circuits to obtain the desired response. However, it is particularly use-
ful in identifying the significance of various parts of a more complex circuit.
It also forms the basis of phasor analysis, which is introduced in Chap. 10.

Each resistor is rated to a maximum of 250 mW. If the circuit allows
this value to be exceeded (by forcing too much current through
either resistor), excessive heating will occur—possibly leading to

CHAPTER 5 HANDY CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
an accident. The 6 V source cannot be changed, so we are looking for an
equation involving I x and the maximum current through each resistor.

Based on its 250 mW power rating, the maximum current the 100
resistor can tolerate is
P max
0.250

R
100
and, similarly, the current through the 64 resistor must be less than
62.5 mA.
᭤ Devise a plan.
Either nodal or mesh analysis may be applied to the solution of this
problem, but superposition may give us a slight edge, since we are
primarily interested in the effect of the current source.
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.
Using superposition, we redraw the circuit as in Fig. 5.5b and find that
the 6 V source contributes a current
6
i 100 =
= 36.59 mA
100 + 64
to the 100 resistor and, since the 64 resistor is in series, i 64 =
36.59 mA as well.
Recognizing the current divider in Fig. 5.5c, we note that i 64 will
add to i 64 , but i 100 is opposite in direction to i 100 . Therefore,
I X can safely contribute 62.5 − 36.59 = 25.91 mA to the 64 resistor
current, and 50 − (−36.59) = 86.59 mA to the 100 resistor current.
The 100 resistor therefore places the following constraint on I x :
100 + 64
I x < (86.59 × 10 −3 )
64
and the 64 resistor requires that
100 + 64
I x < (25.91 × 10 −3 )
100
᭤ Attempt a solution.
Considering the 100 resistor first, we see that I x is limited to I x <
221.9 mA. The 64 resistor limits I x such that I x < 42.49 mA. In
order to satisfy both constraints, I x must be less than 42.49 mA. If the
value is increased, the 64 resistor will overheat long before the
100 resistor does.
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
One particularly useful way to evaluate our solution is to perform a dc
sweep analysis in PSpice as described after the next example. An in-
teresting question, however, is whether we would have expected the
64 resistor to overheat first.
Originally we found that the 100 resistor has a smaller
maximum current, so it might be reasonable to expect it to limit I x .
However, because I x opposes the current sent by the 6 V source
through the 100 resistor but adds to the 6 V source’s contribution
to the current through the 64 resistor, it turns out to work the other
way—it’s the 64 resistor that sets the limit on I x .129

original variables. This prevents the possibility of rather disastrous
errors when we add the individual results.

Select one of the independent sources. Set all other indepen-
dent sources to zero. This means voltage sources are replaced
with short circuits and current sources are replaced with open
circuits. Leave dependent sources in the circuit.
Relabel voltages and currents using suitable notation (e.g.,
v , i 2 ). Be sure to relabel controlling variables of dependent
sources to avoid confusion.
Analyze the simplified ci cuit to find the desi ed currents
and/or voltages.
Repeat steps 1 through 3 until each independent source has
been considered.
Add the partial currents and/or voltages obtained from the
separate analyses. Pay careful attention to voltage signs and
current directions when summing.
Do not add power quantities. If power quantities are required,
calculate only after partial voltages and/or currents have been
summed.
Note that step 1 may be altered in several ways. First, independent
sources can be considered in groups as opposed to individually if it simpli-
fies the analysis, as long as no independent source is included in more than
one subcircuit. Second, it is technically not necessary to set sources to zero,
although this is almost always the best route. For example, a 3 V source may
appear in two subcircuits as a 1.5 V source, since 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 V just as
0 + 3 = 3 V. Because it is unlikely to simplify our analysis, however, there
is little point to such an exercise.
COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
Although PSpice is extremely useful in verifying that we have analyzed
a complete circuit correctly, it can also assist us in determining the
contribution of each source to a particular response. To do this, we
employ what is known as a dc parameter sweep.
Consider the circuit presented in Example 5.2, when we were asked
to determine the maximum positive current that could be obtained from
the current source without exceeding the power rating of either resistor
in the circuit. The circuit is shown redrawn using the Orcad Capture
CIS schematic tool in Fig. 5.8. Note that no value has been assigned
to the current source.
After the schematic has been entered and saved, the next step is
to specify the dc sweep parameters. This option allows us to specify
a range of values for a voltage or current source (in the present case,
the current source I x ), rather than a specific value. Selecting New
Simulation Profil under PSpice, we provide a name for our profile
and are then provided with the dialog box shown in Fig. 5.9.SECTION 5.1 LINEARITY AND SUPERPOSITION
■ FIGURE 5.8
The circuit from Example 5.2.
■ FIGURE 5.9 DC Sweep dialog box shown with I x selected as the sweep variable.
Under Analysis Type, we pull down the DC Sweep option, specify
the “sweep variable’’ as Current Source, and then type in I x in the
Name box. There are several options under Sweep Type: Linear,
Logarithmic, and Value List. The last option allows us to specify each
value to assign to I x . In order to generate a smooth plot, however, we
choose to perform a Linear sweep, with a Start Value of 0 mA, an
End Value of 50 mA, and a value of 0.01 mA for the Increment.
After we perform the simulation, the graphical output package Probe
is automatically launched. When the window appears, the horizontal
axis (corresponding to our variable, I x ) is displayed, but the vertical
axis variable must be chosen. Selecting Add Trace from the Trace
menu, we click on I(R1), then type an asterisk in the Trace Expression
box, click on I(R1) once again, insert yet another asterisk, and finally
type in 100. This asks Probe to plot the power absorbed by the 100
resistor. In a similar fashion, we repeat the process to add the power

absorbed by the 64 resistor, resulting in a plot similar to that shown
in Fig. 5.10a. A horizontal reference line at 250 mW was also added to
the plot by typing 0.250 in the Trace Expression box after selecting
Add Trace from the Trace menu a third time.
We see from the plot that the 64 resistor does exceed its 250 mW
power rating in the vicinity of I x = 43 mA. In contrast, however, we
also see that regardless of the value of the current source I x (provided
that it is between 0 and 50 mA), the 100 resistor will never dissipate
250 mW; in fact, the absorbed power decreases with increasing current
from the current source. If we desire a more precise answer, we can make
use of the cursor tool, which is invoked by selecting Trace, Cursor,
Display from the menu bar. Figure 5.10b shows the result of dragging
cursor 1 to 42.52 A, where the 64 resistor is dissipating just over its
maximum rated power of 250 mW. Increased precision can be obtained
by decreasing the increment value used in the dc sweep.
This technique is very useful in analyzing electronic circuits, where
we might need, for example, to determine what input voltage is required133
SECTION 5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS
to a complicated amplifier circuit in order to obtain a zero output
voltage. We also notice that there are several other types of parameter
sweeps that we can perform, including a dc voltage sweep. The ability to
vary temperature is useful only when dealing with component models
that have a temperature parameter built in, such as diodes and transistors.
Unfortunately, it usually turns out that little if any time is saved in ana-
lyzing a circuit containing one or more dependent sources by use of the
superposition principle, for there must always be at least two sources in
operation: one independent source and all the dependent sources.
We must constantly be aware of the limitations of superposition. It is
applicable only to linear responses, and thus the most common nonlinear
response—power—is not subject to superposition. For example, consider
two 1 V batteries in series with a 1 resistor. The power delivered to the re-
sistor is 4 W, but if we mistakenly try to apply superposition, we might say
that each battery alone furnished 1 W and thus the calculated power is only
2 W. This is incorrect, but a surprisingly easy mistake to make.
5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS
•
Practical Voltage Sources
So far, we’ve only worked with ideal sources—elements whose terminal
voltage is independent of the current flowing through them. To see the
relevance of this fact, consider a simple independent (“ideal”) 9 V source
connected to a 1 resistor. The 9 volt source will force a current of 9 amperes
through the 1 resistor (perhaps this seems reasonable enough), but the same
source would apparently force 9,000,000 amperes through a 1 m resistor
(which hopefully does not seem reasonable). On paper, there's nothing to stop
us from reducing the resistor value all the way to 0 ... but that would lead
to a contradiction, as the source would be “trying” to maintain 9 V across a
dead short, which Ohm’s law tells us can’t happen (V = 9 = R I = 0?).
What happens in the real world when we do this type of experiment? For
example, if we try to start a car with the headlights already on, we most likely
notice the headlights dim as the battery is asked to supply a large (∼100 A or
more) starter current in parallel with the current running to the headlights. If
we model the 12 V battery with an ideal 12 V source as in Fig. 5.11a, our
observation cannot be explained. Another way of saying this is that our model
breaks down when the load draws a large current from the source.
To better approximate the behavior of a real device, the ideal voltage
source must be modified to account for the lowering of its terminal voltage
when large currents are drawn from it. Let us suppose that we observe ex-
perimentally that our car battery has a terminal voltage of 12 V when no
current is flowing through it, and a reduced voltage of 11 V when 100 A is
flowing. How could we model this behavior? Well, a more accurate model
might be an ideal voltage source of 12 V in series with a resistor across
which 1 V appears when 100 A flows through it. A quick calculation shows
that the resistor must be 1 V/100 A 0.01 , and the ideal voltage source
and this series resistor constitute a practical voltage source (Fig. 5.11b).

Thus, we are using the series combination of two ideal circuit elements, an
independent voltage source and a resistor, to model a real device.
We do not expect to find such an arrangement of ideal elements inside
our car battery, of course. Any real device is characterized by a certain
current-voltage relationship at its terminals, and our problem is to develop
some combination of ideal elements that can furnish a similar current-voltage
characteristic, at least over some useful range of current, voltage, or power.
In Fig. 5.12a, we show our two-piece practical model of the car battery
now connected to some load resistor R L . The terminal voltage of the practical
source is the same as the voltage across R L and is marked 2 V L . Figure 5.12b
shows a plot of load voltage V L as a function of the load current I L for this
practical source. The KVL equation for the circuit of Fig. 5.12a may be
written in terms of I L and V L :

increases and R L v L /i L decreases. The terminal
voltage of an ideal voltage source (also plotted)
remains the same for any current delivered to a load.
V L = −0.01I L + 12
This is a linear equation in I L and V L , and the plot in Fig. 5.12b is a straight
line. Each point on the line corresponds to a different value of R L . For exam-
ple, the midpoint of the straight line is obtained when the load resistance is
equal to the internal resistance of the practical source, or R L = 0.01 . Here,
the load voltage is exactly one-half the ideal source voltage.
When R L = ∞ and no current whatsoever is being drawn by the
load, the practical source is open-circuited and the terminal voltage, or
open-circuit voltage, is V Loc = 12 V. If, on the other hand, R L = 0, thereby
short-circuiting the load terminals, then a load current or short-circuit cur-
rent, I Lsc = 1200 A, would flow. (In practice, such an experiment would
probably result in the destruction of the short circuit, the battery, and any
measuring instruments incorporated in the circuit!)
Since the plot of V L versus I L is a straight line for this practical voltage
source, we should note that the values of V Loc and I Lsc uniquely determine
the entire V L –I L curve.
The horizontal broken line of Fig. 5.12b represents the V L –I L plot for an
ideal voltage source; the terminal voltage remains constant for any value of
load current. For the practical voltage source, the terminal voltage has a value
near that of the ideal source only when the load current is relatively small.
Let us now consider a general practical voltage source, as shown in
Fig. 5.13a. The voltage of the ideal source is v s , and a resistance R s , called
an internal resistance or output resistance, is placed in series with it. Again,
we must note that the resistor is not really present as a separate component
but merely serves to account for a terminal voltage that decreases as the
load current increases. Its presence enables us to model the behavior of a
physical voltage source more closely.
The linear relationship between v L and i L is
v L = v s − R s i L
[9]
(2) From this point on we will endeavor to adhere to the standard convention of referring to strictly dc
quantities using capital letters, whereas lowercase letters denote a quantity that we know to possess some
time-varying component. However, in describing general theorems which apply to either dc or ac, we will
continue to use lowercase to emphasize the general nature of the concept.135
SECTION 5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS
and this is plotted in Fig. 5.13b. The open-circuit voltage (R L = ∞, so
i L = 0) is
v Loc = v s
[10]
and the short-circuit current (R L = 0, so v L = 0) is
v s
i Lsc =
R s
[11]
Once again, these values are the intercepts for the straight line in Fig. 5.13b,
and they serve to define it completely.
Practical Current Sources
An ideal current source is also nonexistent in the real world; there is no
physical device that will deliver a constant current regardless of the load re-
sistance to which it is connected or the voltage across its terminals. Certain
transistor circuits will deliver a constant current to a wide range of load re-
sistances, but the load resistance can always be made sufficiently large that
the current through it becomes very small. Infinite power is simply never
available (unfortunately).
A practical current source is defined as an ideal current source in paral-
lel with an internal resistance R p . Such a source is shown in Fig. 5.14a, and
the current i L and voltage v L associated with a load resistance R L are indi-
cated. Application of KCL yields
v L
i L = i s −
[12]
R p
which is again a linear relationship. The open-circuit voltage and the short-
circuit current are

The variation of load current with changing load voltage may be inves-
tigated by changing the value of R L as shown in Fig. 5.14b. The straight line
is traversed from the short-circuit, or “northwest,’’ end to the open-circuit
termination at the “southeast’’ end by increasing R L from zero to infinite
ohms. The midpoint occurs for R L = R p . The load current i L and the ideal
source current are approximately equal only for small values of load volt-
age, which are obtained with values of R L that are small compared to R p .
Equivalent Practical Sources
It may be no surprise that we can improve upon models to increase their
accuracy; at this point we now have a practical voltage source model and
also a practical current source model. Before we proceed, however, let’s
take a moment to compare Fig. 5.13b and Fig. 5.14b. One is for a circuit
with a voltage source and the other, with a current source, but the graphs are
indistinguishable!
It turns out that this is no coincidence. In fact, we are about to show that
a practical voltage source can be electrically equivalent to a practical cur-
rent source—meaning that a load resistor R L connected to either will have
v L

other and the rest of the circuit will not know the difference.
Consider the practical voltage source and resistor R L shown in Fig. 5.15a,
and the circuit composed of a practical current source and resistor R L shown
in Fig. 5.15b. A simple calculation shows that the voltage across the load R L

R s = R p [16]
v s = R p i s = R s i s [17]
and
where we now let R s represent the internal resistance of either practical
source, which is the conventional notation.
Let’s try this with the practical current source shown in Fig. 5.16a. Since
its internal resistance is 2 , the internal resistance of the equivalent practi-
cal voltage source is also 2 ; the voltage of the ideal voltage source con-
tained within the practical voltage source is (2)(3) = 6 V. The equivalent
practical voltage source is shown in Fig. 5.16b.
To check the equivalence, let us visualize a 4 resistor connected to
each source. In both cases a current of 1 A, a voltage of 4 V, and a power of
4 W are associated with the 4 load. However, we should note very care-
fully that the ideal current source is delivering a total power of 12 W, while
the ideal voltage source is delivering only 6 W. Furthermore, the internal
resistance of the practical current source is absorbing 8 W, whereas the in-
ternal resistance of the practical voltage source is absorbing only 2 W. Thus
we see that the two practical sources are equivalent only with respect to
what transpires at the load terminals; they are not equivalent internally!
EXAMPLE 5.4
Compute the current through the 4.7 k⍀ resistor in Fig. 5.17a after
transforming the 9 mA source into an equivalent voltage source.
It’s not just the 9 mA source at issue, but also the resistance in parallel
with it (5 k ). We remove these components, leaving two terminals “dan-
gling.” We then replace them with a voltage source in series with a 5 k
resistor. The value of the voltage source must be (0.09)(5000) ϭ 45 V.
Redrawing the circuit as in Fig. 5.17b, we can write a simple KVL
equation
Ϫ45 ϩ 5000I ϩ 4700I ϩ 3000I ϩ 3 ϭ 0
which is easily solved to yield I ϭ 3.307 mA.
We can check our answer of course by analyzing the circuit of
Fig. 5.17a using either nodal or mesh techniques.SECTION 5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS

EXAMPLE 5.5
Calculate the current through the 2 ⍀ resistor in Fig. 5.19a by
making use of source transformations to first simplify the ci cuit.
We begin by transforming each current source into a voltage source
(Fig. 5.19b), the strategy being to convert the circuit into a simple loop.
We must be careful to retain the 2 resistor for two reasons: first, the
dependent source controlling variable appears across it, and second, we
desire the current flowing through it. However, we can combine the 17
and 9 resistors, since they appear in series. We also see that the 3 and
4 resistors may be combined into a single 7 resistor, which can then
be used to transform the 15 V source into a 15/7 A source as in Fig. 5.19c.
Finally, we note that the two 7 resistors can be combined into a
single 3.5 resistor, which may be used to transform the 15/7 A
current source into a 7.5 V voltage source. The result is a simple
loop circuit, shown in Fig. 5.19d.
The current I can now be found using KVL:
−7.5 + 3.5I − 51V x + 28I + 9 = 0
where
V x = 2I
Thus,
I = 21.28 mA

SECTION 5.2 SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS
Several Key Points
We conclude our discussion of practical sources and source transformations
with a few observations. First, when we transform a voltage source, we
must be sure that the source is in fact in series with the resistor under con-
sideration. For example, in the circuit of Fig. 5.21, it is perfectly valid to
perform a source transformation on the voltage source using the 10 resis-
tor, as they are in series. However, it would be incorrect to attempt a source
transformation using the 60 V source and the 30 resistor—a very common
type of error.
In a similar fashion, when we transform a current source and resistor
combination, we must be sure that they are in fact in parallel. Consider the
current source shown in Fig. 5.22a. We may perform a source transforma-
tion including the 3 resistor, as they are in parallel, but after the transfor-
mation there may be some ambiguity as to where to place the resistor. In
such circumstances, it is helpful to first redraw the components to be trans-
formed as in Fig. 5.22b. Then the transformation to a voltage source in
series with a resistor may be drawn correctly as shown in Fig. 5.22c; the
resistor may in fact be drawn above or below the voltage source.
It is also worthwhile to consider the unusual case of a current source in
series with a resistor, and its dual, the case of a voltage source in parallel

with a resistor. Let’s start with the simple circuit of Fig. 5.23a, where we are
interested only in the voltage across the resistor marked R 2 . We note that re-
gardless of the value of resistor R 1 , V R 2 = I x R 2 . Although we might be
tempted to perform an inappropriate source transformation on such a cir-
cuit, in fact we may simply omit resistor R 1 (provided that it is of no interest
to us itself). A similar situation arises with a voltage source in parallel with
a resistor, as depicted in Fig. 5.23b. Again, if we are only interested in some
quantity regarding resistor R 2 , we may find ourselves tempted to perform
some strange (and incorrect) source transformation on the voltage source
and resistor R 1 . In reality, we may omit resistor R 1 from our circuit as far as
resistor R 2 is concerned—its presence does not alter the voltage across, the
current through, or the power dissipated by resistor R 2 .

A common goal in source transformation is to end up with
either all current sources or all voltage sources in the circuit.
This is especially true if it makes nodal or mesh analysis easier.
Repeated source transformations can be used to simplify a
circuit by allowing resistors and sources to eventually be
combined.
The resistor value does not change during a source transfor-
mation, but it is not the same resistor. This means that currents
or voltages associated with the original resistor are irretrievably
lost when we perform a source transformation.
If the voltage or current associated with a particular resistor is
used as a controlling variable for a dependent source, it should
not be included in any source transformation. The original
resistor must be retained in the final circuit, untouched.
If the voltage or current associated with a particular element is
of interest, that element should not be included in any source
transformation. The original element must be retained in the final
circuit, untouched.
In a source transformation, the head of the current source
arrow corresponds to the “+” terminal of the voltage source.
A source transformation on a current source and resistor
requires that the two elements be in parallel.
A source transformation on a voltage source and resistor
requires that the two elements be in series.SECTION 5.3 THÉVENIN AND NORTON EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
141
5.3 THÉVENIN AND NORTON EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
•
Now that we have been introduced to source transformations and the super-
position principle, it is possible to develop two more techniques that will
greatly simplify the analysis of many linear circuits. The first of these theo-
rems is named after L. C. Thévenin, a French engineer working in telegra-
phy who published the theorem in 1883; the second may be considered a
corollary of the first and is credited to E. L. Norton, a scientist with the Bell
Telephone Laboratories.
Let us suppose that we need to make only a partial analysis of a circuit.
For example, perhaps we need to determine the current, voltage, and power
delivered to a single “load” resistor by the remainder of the circuit, which
may consist of a sizable number of sources and resistors (Fig. 5.24a). Or,
perhaps we wish to find the response for different values of the load resis-
tance. Thévenin’s theorem tells us that it is possible to replace everything
except the load resistor with an independent voltage source in series with a
resistor (Fig. 5.24b); the response measured at the load resistor will be un-
changed. Using Norton’s theorem, we obtain an equivalent composed of an
independent current source in parallel with a resistor (Fig. 5.24c).

Thus, one of the main uses of Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems is the
replacement of a large part of a circuit, often a complicated and uninter-
esting part, with a very simple equivalent. The new, simpler circuit
enables us to make rapid calculations of the voltage, current, and power
which the original circuit is able to deliver to a load. It also helps us to
choose the best value of this load resistance. In a transistor power
amplifier, for example, the Thévenin or Norton equivalent enables us to
determine the maximum power that can be taken from the amplifier and
delivered to the speakers.
EXAMPLE 5.6
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 5.25a. Determine the Thévenin
equivalent of network A, and compute the power delivered to the
load resistor R L .
The dashed regions separate the circuit into networks A and B; our main
interest is in network B, which consists only of the load resistor R L . Net-
work A may be simplified by making repeated source transformations.

We first treat the 12 V source and the 3 resistor as a practical volt-
age source and replace it with a practical current source consisting of a
4 A source in parallel with 3 (Fig. 5.25b). The parallel resistances are
then combined into 2 (Fig. 5.25c), and the practical current source that
results is transformed back into a practical voltage source (Fig. 5.25d).
The final result is shown in Fig. 5.25e.
From the viewpoint of the load resistor R L , this network A (the
Thévenin equivalent) is equivalent to the original network A; from our
viewpoint, the circuit is much simpler, and we can now easily compute
the power delivered to the load:
P L =
8
9 + R L
2
R L
Furthermore, we can see from the equivalent circuit that the maxi-
mum voltage that can be obtained across R L is 8 V and corresponds to
R L = ∞. A quick transformation of network A to a practical current
source (the Norton equivalent) indicates that the maximum current that
may be delivered to the load is 8/9 A, which occurs when R L = 0.
Neither of these facts is readily apparent from the original circuit.

Thévenin’s Theorem
Using the technique of source transformation to find a Thévenin or Norton
equivalent network worked well enough in Example 5.6, but it can rapidly
become impractical in situations where dependent sources are present or
the circuit is composed of a large number of elements. An alternative is to
employ Thévenin’s theorem (or Norton’s theorem) instead. We will state
the theorem 3 as a somewhat formal procedure and then consider various
ways to make the approach more practical depending on the situation
we face.
A Statement of Thévenin’s Theorem
Given any linear circuit, rearrange it in the form of two
networks, A and B, connected by two wires. Network A is
the network to be simplified; B will be left untouched.
2. Disconnect network B. Define a voltage v oc as the voltage now
appearing across the terminals of network A.
3. Turn off or “zero out” every independent source in network A
to form an inactive network. Leave dependent sources
unchanged.
4. Connect an independent voltage source with value v oc in series
with the inactive network. Do not complete the circuit; leave the
two terminals disconnected.
5. Connect network B to the terminals of the new network A.
All currents and voltages in B will remain unchanged.
1.
Note that if either network contains a dependent source, its control
variable must be in the same network.
Let us see if we can apply Thévenin’s theorem successfully to the circuit
we considered in Fig. 5.25. We have already found the Thévenin equivalent
of the circuit to the left of R L in Example 5.6, but we want to see if there is
an easier way to obtain the same result.
EXAMPLE 5.7
Use Thévenin’s theorem to determine the Thévenin equivalent for
that part of the circuit in Fig. 5.25a to the left of R L .
We begin by disconnecting R L , and note that no current flows through
the 7 resistor in the resulting partial circuit shown in Fig. 5.27a.
Thus, V oc appears across the 6 resistor (with no current through the
7 resistor there is no voltage drop across it), and voltage division
enables us to determine that
V oc = 12
6
3 + 6
= 8V
(3) A proof of Thévenin’s theorem in the form in which we have stated it is rather lengthy, and therefore it
has been placed in Appendix 3, where the curious may peruse it.144

effective resistance of network A.
Turning off network A (i.e., replacing the 12 V source with a short
circuit) and looking back into the dead network, we see a 7 resistor
connected in series with the parallel combination of 6 and 3
(Fig. 5.27b).
Thus, the inactive network can be represented here by a 9 resistor,
referred to as the Thévenin equivalent resistance of network A. The
Thévenin equivalent then is V oc in series with a 9 resistor, which
agrees with our previous result.

A Few Key Points
The equivalent circuit we have learned how to obtain is completely inde-
pendent of network B: we have been instructed to first remove network B and
then measure the open-circuit voltage produced by network A, an operation
that certainly does not depend on network B in any way. The B network is
mentioned only to indicate that an equivalent for A may be obtained no mat-
ter what arrangement of elements is connected to the A network; the B net-
work represents this general network.
There are several points about the theorem which deserve emphasis.
•
•
•
The only restriction that we must impose on A or B is that all
dependent sources in A have their control variables in A, and similarly
for B.
No restrictions are imposed on the complexity of A or B; either one
may contain any combination of independent voltage or current
sources, linear dependent voltage or current sources, resistors, or any
other circuit elements which are linear.
The dead network A can be represented by a single equivalent resis-
tance R TH , which we will call the Thévenin equivalent resistance.SECTION 5.3 THÉVENIN AND NORTON EQUIVALENT CIRCUITS
•
This holds true whether or not dependent sources exist in the inactive
A network, an idea we will explore shortly.
A Thévenin equivalent consists of two components: a voltage source
in series with a resistance. Either may be zero, although this is not
usually the case.
Norton’s Theorem
Norton’s theorem bears a close resemblance to Thévenin’s theorem and
may be stated as follows:
A Statement of Norton’s Theorem
Given any linear circuit, rearrange it in the form of two
networks, A and B, connected by two wires. Network A is the
network to be simplified; B will be left untouched. As before, if
either network contains a dependent source, its controlling
variable must be in the same network.
2. Disconnect network B, and short the terminals of A. Define
a current i sc as the current now flowing through the shorted
terminals of network A.
3. Turn off or “zero out” every independent source in network
A to form an inactive network. Leave dependent sources
unchanged.
4. Connect an independent current source with value i sc in
parallel with the inactive network. Do not complete the circuit;
leave the two terminals disconnected.
5. Connect network B to the terminals of the new network A.
All currents and voltages in B will remain unchanged.
1.
The Norton equivalent of a linear network is the Norton current source
i sc in parallel with the Thévenin resistance R TH . Thus, we see that in fact it
is possible to obtain the Norton equivalent of a network by performing a
source transformation on the Thévenin equivalent. This results in a direct
relationship between v oc , i sc , and R TH :
v oc = R TH i sc
[18]
In circuits containing dependent sources, we will often find it more con-
venient to determine either the Thévenin or Norton equivalent by finding
both the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current and then deter-
mining the value of R TH as their quotient. It is therefore advisable to be-
come adept at finding both open-circuit voltages and short-circuit currents,
even in the simple problems that follow. If the Thévenin and Norton equiv-
alents are determined independently, Eq. [18] can serve as a useful check.
Let’s consider three different examples of the determination of a
Thévenin or Norton equivalent circuit.

From the wording of the problem statement, network B is the 1 k
resistor, so network A is everything else.
Choosing to find the Thévenin equivalent of network A first, we
apply superposition, noting that no current flows through the 3 k
resistor once network B is disconnected. With the current source set
to zero, V oc| 4 V ϭ 4 V. With the voltage source set to zero,
V oc| 2 mA ϭ (0.002)(2000) ϭ 4 V. Thus, V oc ϭ 4 ϩ 4 ϭ 8 V.
To find R TH , set both sources to zero as in Fig. 5.29b. By inspection,
R TH ϭ 2 k ϩ 3 k ϭ 5 k . The complete Thévenin equivalent, with
network B reconnected, is shown in Fig. 5.29c.
The Norton equivalent is found by a simple source transformation of
the Thévenin equivalent, resulting in a current source of 8/5000 ϭ 1.6 mA
in parallel with a 5 k resistor (Fig. 5.29d).

When Dependent Sources Are Present
Technically speaking, there does not always have to be a “network B” for us
to invoke either Thévenin’s theorem or Norton’s theorem; we could instead
be asked to find the equivalent of a network with two terminals not yet con-
nected to another network. If there is a network B that we do not want to in-
volve in the simplification procedure, however, we must use a little caution
if it contains dependent sources. In such situations, the controlling variable
and the associated element(s) must be included in network B and excluded
from network A. Otherwise, there will be no way to analyze the final circuit
because the controlling quantity will be lost.
If network A contains a dependent source, then again we must ensure
that the controlling variable and its associated element(s) cannot be in net-
work B. Up to now, we have only considered circuits with resistors and in-
dependent sources. Although technically speaking it is correct to leave a
dependent source in the “inactive” network when creating a Thévenin or
Norton equivalent, in practice this does not result in any kind of simplifica-
tion. What we really want is an independent voltage source in series with a
single resistor, or an independent current source in parallel with a single
resistor—in other words, a two-component equivalent. In the following
examples, we consider various means of reducing networks with dependent
sources and resistors into a single resistance.

To find V oc we note that v x = V oc and that the dependent source current

the 3 k resistor. Using KVL around the outer loop:

and
v x = 8 V = V oc
By Thévenin’s theorem, then, the equivalent circuit could be formed
with the inactive A network in series with an 8 V source, as shown in
Fig. 5.31b. This is correct, but not very simple and not very helpful;
in the case of linear resistive networks, we really want a simpler
equivalent for the inactive A network, namely, R TH .
The dependent source prevents us from determining R TH directly for
the inactive network through resistance combination; we therefore seek
I sc . Upon short-circuiting the output terminals in Fig. 5.31a, it is
apparent that V x = 0 and the dependent current source is not active.
Hence, I sc = 4/(5 × 10 3 ) = 0.8 mA. Thus,

The rightmost terminals are already open-circuited, hence i = 0.
Consequently, the dependent source is inactive, so v oc = 0.
We next seek the value of R TH represented by this two-terminal
network. However, we cannot find v oc and i sc and take their quotient,
for there is no independent source in the network and both v oc and i sc
are zero. Let us, therefore, be a little tricky.
We apply a 1 A source externally, measure the voltage v test that
results, and then set R TH = v test /1. Referring to Fig. 5.33b, we see
that i = −1 A. Applying nodal analysis,
v test − 1.5(−1) v test

so that

and thus

The Thévenin equivalent is shown in Fig. 5.33c.
A Quick Recap of Procedures
We have now looked at three examples in which we determined a Thévenin
or Norton equivalent circuit. The first example (Fig. 5.29) contained only
independent sources and resistors, and several different methods could have
been applied to it. One would involve calculating R TH for the inactive
network and then V oc for the live network. We could also have found R TH
and I sc , or V oc and I sc .PRACTICAL APPLICATION
The Digital Multimeter
One of the most common pieces of electrical test equip-
ment is the DMM, or digital multimeter (Fig. 5.34),
which is designed to measure voltage, current, and resis-
tance values.

Thévenin equivalent resistance. This Thévenin equivalent
resistance will appear in parallel with our circuit, and its
value can affect the measurement (Fig. 5.36). The DMM
does not supply power to the circuit to measure voltage,
so its Thévenin equivalent consists of only a resistance,
which we will name R DMM .
1 k⍀

■ FIGURE 5.34 A handheld digital multimeter.
In a voltage measurement, two leads from the DMM
are connected across the appropriate circuit element, as
depicted in Fig. 5.35. The positive reference terminal of
the meter is typically marked “V/ ,” and the negative
reference terminal—often referred to as the common
terminal—is typically designated by “COM.” The
convention is to use a red lead for the positive reference
terminal and a black lead for the common terminal.
From our discussion of Thévenin and Norton equiva-
lents, it may now be apparent that the DMM has its own

R DMM
■ FIGURE 5.36 DMM in Fig. 5.35 shown as its Thévenin equivalent
resistance, R DMM .
The input resistance of a good DMM is typically
10 M or more. The measured voltage V thus appears
across 1 k 10 M = 999.9 . Using voltage division,
we find that V = 4.4998 volts, slightly less than the ex-
pected value of 4.5 volts. Thus, the finite input resistance
of the voltmeter introduces a small error in the measured
value.
In the second example (Fig. 5.31), both independent and dependent
sources were present, and the method we used required us to find V oc and
I sc . We could not easily find R TH for the inactive network because the
dependent source could not be made inactive.
The last example did not contain any independent sources, and therefore
the Thévenin and Norton equivalents do not contain an independent source.
We found R TH by applying 1 A and finding v test = 1 × R TH . We could also
apply 1 V and determine i = 1/R TH . These two related techniques can be
applied to any circuit with dependent sources, as long as all independent
sources are set to zero firs .
Two other methods have a certain appeal because they can be used for
any of the three types of networks considered. In the first, simply replace
network B with a voltage source v s , define the current leaving its positive
terminal as i, analyze network A to obtain i, and put the equation in the form
v s = ai + b. Then, a = R TH and b = v oc .To measure current, the DMM must be placed in se-
ries with a circuit element, generally requiring that we
cut a wire (Fig. 5.37). One DMM lead is connected to the
common terminal of the meter, and the other lead is
placed in a connector usually marked “A” to signify cur-
rent measurement. Again, the DMM does not supply
power to the circuit in this type of measurement.

the meter, we may not even notice the effect of nonzero
DMM resistance on our measurement.
The same meter can be used to determine resistance,
provided no independent sources are active during the
measurement. Internally, a known current is passed
through the resistor being measured, and the voltmeter
circuitry is used to measure the resulting voltage. Re-
placing the DMM with its Norton equivalent (which now
includes an active independent current source to gener-
ate the predetermined current), we see that R DMM ap-
pears in parallel with our unknown resistor R (Fig. 5.38).

We see that the Thévenin equivalent resistance
(R DMM ) of the DMM is in series with our circuit, so its
value can affect the measurement. Writing a simple KVL
equation around the loop,
−9 + 1000I + R DMM I + 1000I = 0
Note that since we have reconfigured the meter to
perform a current measurement, the Thévenin equivalent
resistance is not the same as when the meter is config-
ured to measure voltages. In fact, we would ideally like
R DMM to be 0 for current measurements, and ∞ for
voltage measurements. If R DMM is now 0.1 , we see
that the measured current I is 4.4998 mA, which is only
slightly different from the expected value of 4.5 mA. De-
pending on the number of digits that can be displayed by
■ FIGURE 5.38 DMM in resistance measurement configuration replaced by
its Norton equivalent, showing R DMM in parallel with the unknown resistor R
to be measured.
As a result, the DMM actually measures R R DMM . If
R DMM = 10 M and R = 10 , R measured = 9.99999 ,
which is more than accurate enough for most purposes.
However, if R = 10 M , R measured = 5 M . The input
resistance of a DMM therefore places a practical upper
limit on the values of resistance that can be measured,
and special techniques must be used to measure larger
resistances. We should note that if a digital multimeter
is programmed with knowledge of R DMM , it is pos-
sible to compensate and allow measurement of larger
resistances.
We could also apply a current source i s , let its voltage be v, and then de-
termine i s = cv − d, where c = 1/R TH and d = i sc (the minus sign arises
from assuming both current source arrows are directed into the same node).
Both of these last two procedures are universally applicable, but some other
method can usually be found that is easier and more rapid.
Although we are devoting our attention almost entirely to the analysis of
linear circuits, it is good to know that Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are
both valid if network B is nonlinear; only network A must be linear.

5.4 MAXIMUM POWER TRANSFER

cal voltage or current source. For the practical voltage source (Fig. 5.40),
the power delivered to the load R L is

■ FIGURE 5.40 A practical voltage source connected

v s 2 R L
(R s + R L ) 2
[19]
To find the value of R L that absorbs maximum power from the given
practical source, we differentiate with respect to R L :
dp L
(R s + R L ) 2 v s 2 − v s 2 R L (2)(R s + R L )
=
d R L
(R s + R L ) 4
and equate the derivative to zero, obtaining
2R L (R s + R L ) = (R s + R L ) 2
or
R s = R L
Since the values R L = 0 and R L = ∞ both give a minimum ( p L = 0),
and since we have already developed the equivalence between practical
voltage and current sources, we have therefore proved the following
maximum power transfer theorem:
An independent voltage source in series with a resistance R s , or an independent
current source in parallel with a resistance R s , delivers maximum power to a
load resistance R L such that R L = R s .
An alternative way to view the maximum power theorem is possible in
terms of the Thévenin equivalent resistance of a network:
A network delivers maximum power to a load resistance R L when R L is equal
to a the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network.
Thus, the maximum power transfer theorem tells us that a 2 resistor
draws the greatest power (4.5 W) from either practical source of Fig. 5.16,
whereas a resistance of 0.01 receives the maximum power (3.6 kW) in
Fig. 5.11.
There is a distinct difference between drawing maximum power from a
source and delivering maximum power to a load. If the load is sized such
that its Thévenin resistance is equal to the Thévenin resistance of the net-
work to which it is connected, it will receive maximum power from that
network. Any change to the load resistance will reduce the power delivered
to the load. However, consider just the Thévenin equivalent of the network
itself. We draw the maximum possible power from the voltage source by
drawing the maximum possible current—which is achieved by shorting the
network terminals! However, in this extreme example we deliver zero
power to the “load”—a short circuit in this case—as p = i 2 R, and we just
set R = 0 by shorting the network terminals.

mum power transfer requirement that R L = R s = R TH will provide

where v TH and R TH recognize that the practical voltage source of Fig. 5.40
can also be viewed as a Thévenin equivalent of some specific source.
It is also not uncommon for the maximum power theorem to be misin-
terpreted. It is designed to help us select an optimum load in order to maxi-
mize power absorption. If the load resistance is already specified, however,
the maximum power theorem is of no assistance. If for some reason we can
affect the size of the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network con-
nected to our load, setting it equal to the load does not guarantee maximum
power transfer to our predetermined load. A quick consideration of the
power lost in the Thévenin resistance will clarify this point.

The circuit shown in Fig. 5.41 is a model for the common-emitter
bipolar junction transistor amplifie . Choose a load resistance so

Since it is the load resistance we are asked to determine, the maximum

of the rest of the circuit.
We first determine the Thévenin equivalent resistance, which
requires that we remove R L and short-circuit the independent source

CHAPTER 5 HANDY CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
Since v π = 0, the dependent current source is an open circuit, and
R TH 1 k . This can be verified by connecting an independent 1 A
current source across the 1 k resistor; v π will still be zero, so the
dependent source remains inactive and hence contributes nothing
to R TH .
In order to obtain maximum power delivered into the load, R L
should be set to R TH = 1 k .
To find v TH we consider the circuit shown in Fig. 5.42b, which is
Fig. 5.41 with R L removed. We may write
v oc = −0.03v π (1000) = −30v π
where the voltage v π may be found from simple voltage division:

5.5 DELTA-WYE CONVERSION
•
We saw previously that identifying parallel and series combinations of re-
sistors can often lead to a significant reduction in the complexity of a circuit.
In situations where such combinations do not exist, we can often make use
of source transformations to enable such simplifications. There is another
useful technique, called -Y (delta-wye) conversion, that arises out of net-
work theory.
Consider the circuits in Fig. 5.44. There are no series or parallel combi-
nations that can be made to further simplify any of the circuits (note that
5.44a and 5.44b are identical, as are 5.44c and 5.44d), and without any155

sources present, no source transformations can be performed. However, it is
possible to convert between these two types of networks.
We first define two voltages v ac and v bc , and three currents i 1 , i 2 , and i 3
as depicted in Fig. 5.45. If the two networks are equivalent, then the terminal
voltages and currents must be equal (there is no current i 2 in the T-connected
network). A set of relationships between R A , R B , R C and R 1 , R 2 , and R 3 can
now be defined simply by performing mesh analysis. For example, for the
network of Fig. 5.45a we may write
R A i 1 − R A i 2
= v ac
−R A i 1 + (R A + R B + R C )i 2 − R C i 3 = 0

[26]
Comparing terms between Eq. [25] and Eq. [23], we see that

R A + R B + R C
In a similar fashion, we may find expressions for R 1 and R 2 in terms of
R A , R B , and R C , as well as expressions for R A , R B , and R C in terms of R 1 , R 2 ,
and R 3 ; we leave the remainder of the derivations as an exercise for the
reader. Thus, to convert from a Y network to a network, the new resistor

We see that the network in Fig. 5.46a is composed of two -connected
networks that share the 3 resistor. We must be careful at this point
not to be too eager, attempting to convert both -connected networks
to two Y-connected networks. The reason for this may be more obvious
after we convert the top network consisting of the 1 , 4 , and 3
resistors into a Y-connected network (Fig. 5.46b).
Note that in converting the upper network to a Y-connected network,
we have removed the 3 resistor. As a result, there is no way to con-
vert the original -connected network consisting of the 2 , 5 , and
3 resistors into a Y-connected network.
We proceed by combining the 38 and 2 resistors and the 32
and 5 resistors (Fig. 5.46c). We now have a 19

.SECTION 5.6 SELECTING AN APPROACH: A SUMMARY OF VARIOUS TECHNIQUES
5.6 SELECTING AN APPROACH: A SUMMARY
• OF VARIOUS TECHNIQUES
In Chap. 3, we were introduced to Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and
Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL). These two laws apply to any circuit we will
ever encounter, provided that we take care to consider the entire system that
the circuits represent. The reason for this is that KCL and KVL enforce
charge and energy conservation, respectively, which are fundamental prin-
ciples. Based on KCL, we developed the very powerful method of nodal
analysis. A similar technique based on KVL (unfortunately only applicable
to planar circuits) is known as mesh analysis and is also a useful circuit
analysis approach.
For the most part, this text is concerned with developing analytical skills
that apply to linear circuits. If we know a circuit is constructed of only lin-
ear components (in other words, all voltages and currents are related by
linear functions), then we can often simplify circuits prior to employing
either mesh or nodal analysis. Perhaps the most important result that comes
from the knowledge that we are dealing with a completely linear system is
that the principle of superposition applies: given a number of independent
sources acting on our circuit, we can add the contribution of each source
independently of the other sources. This technique is extremely pervasive
throughout the field of engineering, and we will encounter it often. In many
real situations, we will find that although several “sources’’ are acting
simultaneously on our “system,’’ typically one of them dominates the system
response. Superposition allows us to quickly identify that source, provided
that we have a reasonably accurate linear model of the system.
However, from a circuit analysis standpoint, unless we are asked to find
which independent source contributes the most to a particular response, we
find that rolling up our sleeves and launching straight into either nodal or
mesh analysis is often a more straightforward tactic. The reason for this is
that applying superposition to a circuit with 12 independent sources will
require us to redraw the original circuit 12 times, and often we will have to
apply nodal or mesh analysis to each partial circuit, anyway.
The technique of source transformations, on the other hand, is often a
very useful tool in circuit analysis. Performing source transformations can
allow us to consolidate resistors or sources that are not in series or parallel
in the original circuit. Source transformations may also allow us to convert
all or at least most of the sources in the original circuit to the same type
(either all voltage sources or all current sources), so nodal or mesh analysis
is more straightforward.
Thévenin’s theorem is extremely important for a number of reasons. In
working with electronic circuits, we are always aware of the Thévenin
equivalent resistance of different parts of our circuit, especially the input
and output resistances of amplifier stages. The reason for this is that match-
ing of resistances is frequently the best route to optimizing the performance
of a given circuit. We have seen a small preview of this in our discussion of
maximum power transfer, where the load resistance should be chosen to
match the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network to which the load
is connected. In terms of day-to-day circuit analysis, however, we find that
converting part of a circuit to its Thévenin or Norton equivalent is almost as
much work as analyzing the complete circuit. Therefore, as in the case of
157158
CHAPTER 5 HANDY CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
superposition, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are typically applied only
when we require specialized information about part of our circuit.
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
Although we asserted in Chap. 4 that nodal analysis and mesh analysis are
sufficient to analyze any circuit we might encounter (provided we have the
means to relate voltage and current for any passive element, such as Ohm’s
law for resistors), the simple truth is that often we do not really need all
voltages, or all currents. Sometimes, it is simply one element, or a small
portion of a larger circuit, that has our attention. Perhaps there is some un-
certainty in the final value of a particular element, and we’d like to see how
the circuit performs over the range of expected values. In such instances, we
can exploit the fact that at the moment we have confined ourselves to linear
circuits. This allows the development of other tools: superposition, where
individual contributions of sources can be identified; source transforma-
tions, where a voltage source in series with a resistor can be replaced with a
current source in parallel with a resistor; and the most powerful of all—
Thévenin (and Norton) equivalents.
An interesting offshoot of these topics is the idea of maximum power
transfer. Assuming we can represent our (arbitrarily complex) circuit by
two networks, one passive and one active, maximum power transfer to the
passive network is achieved when its Thévenin resistance is equal to the
Thévenin resistance of the active network. Finally, we introduced the con-
cept of delta-wye conversion, a process that allows us to simplify some re-
sistive networks which at face value are not reducible using standard series-
parallel combination techniques.
We are still faced with the perpetual question, “Which tool should I use
to analyze this circuit?” The answer typically lies in the type of information
required about our circuit. Experience will eventually guide us a bit, but it
is not always true that there is one “best” approach. Certainly one issue to
focus on is whether one or more components might be changed—this can
suggest whether superposition, a Thévenin equivalent, or a partial simplifi-
cation such as can be achieved with source or delta-wye transformation is
the most practical route.
We conclude this chapter by reviewing key points, along with identify-
ing relevant example(s).
❑ The principle of superposition states that the response in a linear
circuit can be obtained by adding the individual responses caused
by the separate independent sources acting alone. (Examples 5.1,
5.2, 5.3)
❑ Superposition is most often used when it is necessary to determine the
individual contribution of each source to a particular response.
(Examples 5.2, 5.3)
❑ A practical model for a real voltage source is a resistor in series with an
independent voltage source. A practical model for a real current source
is a resistor in parallel with an independent current source.
❑ Source transformations allow us to convert a practical voltage source
into a practical current source, and vice versa. (Example 5.4)EXERCISES
❑

❑
Repeated source transformations can greatly simplify analysis of a
circuit by providing the means to combine resistors and sources.
(Example 5.5)
The Thévenin equivalent of a network is a resistor in series with an
independent voltage source. The Norton equivalent is the same resistor
in parallel with an independent current source. (Example 5.6)
There are several ways to obtain the Thévenin equivalent resistance,
depending on whether or not dependent sources are present in the
network. (Examples 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10)
Maximum power transfer occurs when the load resistor matches the
Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network to which it is connected.
(Example 5.11)
When faced with a ∆-connected resistor network, it is straightforward
to convert it to a Y-connected network. This can be useful in simplify-
ing the network prior to analysis. Conversely, a Y-connected resistor
network can be converted to a ∆-connected network to assist in
simplification of the network. (Example 5.12)

your model yield a “reasonable” approximation to e x ? Explain your
reasoning.

of t does your model provide a “reasonable” approximation to the actual
(nonlinear) function y(t)? Explain your reasoning.

INTRODUCTION
At this point we have a good set of circuit analysis tools at our dis-
posal, but have focused primarily on somewhat general circuits
composed of only sources and resistors. In this chapter, we intro-
duce a new component which, although technically nonlinear, can
be treated effectively with linear models. This element, known as
the operational amplifie or op amp for short, finds daily usage in a
large variety of electronic applications. It also provides us a new
element to use in building circuits, and another opportunity to test
out our developing analytical skills.

•
The origins of the operational amplifier date to the 1940s, when
basic circuits were constructed using vacuum tubes to perform
mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplica-
tion, division, differentiation, and integration. This enabled the con-
struction of analog (as opposed to digital) computers tasked with the
solution of complex differential equations. The first commercially
available op amp device is generally considered to be the K2-W,
manufactured by Philbrick Researches, Inc. of Boston from about
1952 through the early 1970s (Fig. 6.1a). These early vacuum
tube devices weighed 3 oz (85 g), measured 1 33 / 64 in × 2 9 / 64 in ×
4 7 / 64 in (3.8 cm × 5.4 cm × 10.4 cm), and sold for about US$22.
In contrast, integrated circuit (IC) op amps such as the Fairchild
KA741 weigh less than 500 mg, measure 5.7 mm × 4.9 mm ×
1.8 mm, and sell for approximately US$0.22.
Compared to op amps based on vacuum tubes, modern IC op
amps are constructed using perhaps 25 or more transistors all on the
same silicon “chip,” as well as resistors and capacitors needed to ob-
tain the desired performance characteristics. As a result, they run at

much lower dc supply voltages (±18 V, for example, as opposed to ±300 V
for the K2-W), are more reliable, and considerably smaller (Fig. 6.1b,c). In
some cases, the IC may contain several op amps. In addition to the output pin
and the two inputs, other pins enable power to be supplied to run the transis-
tors, and for external adjustments to be made to balance and compensate the
op amp. The symbol commonly used for an op amp is shown in Fig. 6.2a. At
this point, we are not concerned with the internal circuitry of the op amp or the
IC, but only with the voltage and current relationships that exist between the
input and output terminals. Thus, for the time being we will use a simpler elec-
trical symbol, shown in Fig. 6.2b. Two input terminals are shown on the left,
and a single output terminal appears at the right. The terminal marked by a
“+” is referred to as the noninverting input, and the “−” marked terminal is
called the inverting input.
6.2 THE IDEAL OP AMP: A CORDIAL INTRODUCTION
•
In practice, we find that most op amps perform so well that we can often
make the assumption that we are dealing with an “ideal” op amp. The char-
acteristics of an ideal op amp form the basis for two fundamental rules that
at first may seem somewhat unusual:
Ideal Op Amp Rules
1. No current ever flows into either input terminal.
2. There is no voltage difference between the two input terminals.
In a real op amp, a very small leakage current will flow into the input
(sometimes as low as 40 femtoamperes). It is also possible to obtain a very
small voltage across the two input terminals. However, compared to other
voltages and currents in most circuits, such values are so small that includ-
ing them in the analysis does not typically affect our calculations.
When analyzing op amp circuits, we should keep one other point in mind.
As opposed to the circuits that we have studied so far, an op amp circuit al-
ways has an output that depends on some type of input. Therefore, we will an-
alyze op amp circuits with the goal of obtaining an expression for the output
in terms of the input quantities. We will fin that it is usually a good idea to
begin the analysis of an op amp circuit at the input, and proceed from there.177
SECTION 6.2 THE IDEAL OP AMP: A CORDIAL INTRODUCTION
The circuit shown in Fig. 6.3 is known as an inverting amplifie . We
choose to analyze this circuit using KVL, beginning with the input voltage
source. The current labeled i flows only through the two resistors R 1 and R f ;
ideal op amp rule 1 states that no current flows into the inverting input
terminal. Thus, we can write
R f
R 1
–
i
v in
−v in + R 1 i + R f i + v out = 0
which can be rearranged to obtain an equation that relates the output to the
input:
v out = v in − (R 1 + R f )i

■ FIGURE 6.3 An op amp used to construct an
inverting amplifier circuit. The current i flows to ground
through the output pin of the op amp.
Given v in = 5 sin 3t mV, R 1 4.7 k , and R f 47 k , we require one
additional equation that expresses i only in terms of v out , v in , R 1 , and/or R f .
This is a good time to mention that we have not yet made use of ideal
op amp rule 2. Since the noninverting input is grounded, it is at zero volts.
By ideal op amp rule 2, the inverting input is therefore also at zero volts!
This does not mean that the two inputs are physically shorted together, and
we should be careful not to make such an assumption. Rather, the two input
voltages simply track each other: if we try to change the voltage at one pin,
the other pin will be driven by internal circuitry to the same value. Thus, we
can write one more KVL equation:
−v in + R 1 i + 0 = 0
or
i =
v in
R 1
[2]
Combining Eq. [2] with Eq. [1], we obtain an expression for v out in
terms of v in :
v out = −
R f
v in
R 1
[3]
The fact that the inverting input terminal finds itself at
zero volts in this type of circuit configuration leads to
what is often referred to as a “virtual ground.” This does
not mean that the pin is actually grounded, which is
sometimes a source of confusion for students. The
op amp makes whatever internal adjustments are
necessary to prevent a voltage difference between the
input terminals. The input terminals are not shorted
together.
Substituting v in = 5 sin 3t mV, R 1 = 4.7 k , and R f = 47 k ,
mV
Since R f > R 1 , this circuit amplifies the input voltage signal v in . If we
choose R f < R 1 , the signal will be attenuated instead. We also note that the
output voltage has the opposite sign of the input voltage, 1 hence the name
“inverting amplifier.” The output is sketched in Fig. 6.4, along with the in-
put waveform for comparison.
At this point, it is worth mentioning that the ideal op amp seems to be
violating KCL. Specifically, in the above circuit no current flows into or out
of either input terminal, but somehow current is able to flow into the output
pin! This would imply that the op amp is somehow able to either create elec-
trons out of nowhere or store them forever (depending on the direction of
current flow). Obviously, this is not possible. The conflict arises because we
have been treating the op amp the same way we treated passive elements
(1) Or, “the output is 180 ◦ out of phase with the input,” which sounds more impressive.

such as the resistor. In reality, however, the op amp cannot function unless
it is connected to external power sources. It is through those power sources
that we can direct current flow through the output terminal.
Although we have shown that the inverting amplifier circuit of Fig. 6.3
can amplify an ac signal (a sine wave in this case having a frequency of
3 rad/s and an amplitude of 5 mV), it works just as well with dc inputs. We
consider this type of situation in Fig. 6.5, where values for R 1 and R f are to
be selected to obtain an output voltage of −10 V.
This is the same circuit as shown in Fig. 6.3, but with a 2.5 V dc input.
Since no other change has been made, the expression we presented as Eq. [3]
is valid for this circuit as well. To obtain the desired output, we seek a ratio
of R f to R 1 of 10/2.5, or 4. Since it is only the ratio that is important here, we
simply need to pick a convenient value for one resistor, and the other resis-
tor value is then fixed at the same time. For example, we could choose
R 1 = 100 (so R f = 400 ), or even R f = 8 M (so R 1 = 2 M ). In
practice, other constraints (such as bias current) may limit our choices.
This circuit configuration therefore acts as a convenient type of voltage
amplifier (or attenuator, if the ratio of R f to R 1 is less than 1), but does
have the sometimes inconvenient property of inverting the sign of the input.
There is an alternative, however, which is analyzed just as easily—the non-
inverting amplifier shown in Fig. 6.6. We examine such a circuit in the
following example.

Note that we are using ideal op amp rule 1 implicitly by defining the
same current through both resistors: no current flows into the invert-

for v out in terms of v in , we thus find that179

Our goal is to obtain a single expression that relates the input and

However, we have not yet employed ideal op amp rule 2, and we will
find that in almost every op amp circuit both rules need to be invoked
in order to obtain such an expression.
Thus, we recognize that v a = v b = v in , and Eq. [4] becomes

The output waveform is sketched in Fig. 6.7, along with the input
waveform for comparison. In contrast to the output waveform of the
inverting amplifier circuit, we note that the input and output are in
phase for the noninverting amplifier. This should not be entirely
unexpected: it is implicit in the name “noninverting amplifier.”

Just like the inverting amplifier, the noninverting amplifier works with
dc as well as ac inputs, but has a voltage gain of v out /v in = 1 + (R f /R 1 ).
Thus, if we set R f = 9 and R 1 = 1 , we obtain an output v out which is
10 times larger than the input voltage v in . In contrast to the inverting ampli-
fier, the output and input of the noninverting amplifier always have the same
sign, and the output voltage cannot be less than the input; the minimum gain
is 1. Which amplifier we choose depends on the application we are consid-
ering. In the special case of the voltage follower circuit shown in Fig. 6.8,

which represents a noninverting amplifier with R 1 set to ∞ and R f set to
zero, the output is identical to the input in both sign and magnitude. This
may seem rather pointless as a general type of circuit, but we should keep in
mind that the voltage follower draws no current from the input (in the ideal
case)—it therefore can act as a buffer between the voltage v in and some re-
sistive load R L connected to the output of the op amp.
We mentioned earlier that the name “operational amplifier” originates
from using such devices to perform arithmetical operations on analog (i.e.,
nondigitized, real-time, real-world) signals. As we see in the following two
circuits, this includes both addition and subtraction of input voltage signals.

■ FIGURE 6.9 Basic summing amplifier circuit with three inputs.
We first note that this circuit is similar to the inverting amplifier circuit
of Fig. 6.3. Again, the goal is to obtain an expression for v out (which
in this case appears across a load resistor R L ) in terms of the inputs
(v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 ).
Since no current can flow into the inverting input terminal, we can
write
i = i 1 + i 2 + i 3
Therefore, we can write the following equation at the node labeled v a :
0 =
v a − v 1

This equation contains both v out and the input voltages, but unfortu-
nately it also contains the nodal voltage v a . To remove this unknown
quantity from our expression, we need to write an additional equation
that relates v a to v out , the input voltages, R f , and/or R. At this point, we
remember that we have not yet used ideal op amp rule 2, and that we
will almost certainly require the use of both rules when analyzing an
op amp circuit. Thus, since v a = v b = 0, we can write the following:

Rearranging, we obtain the following expression for v out :

v out = − (v 1 + v 2 + v 3 )
[6]
R
In the special case where v 2 = v 3 = 0, we see that our result agrees
with Eq. [3], which was derived for essentially the same circuit.
There are several interesting features about the result we have just de-
rived. First, if we select R f so that it is equal to R, then the output is the (neg-
ative of the) sum of the three input signals v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 . Further, we can select
the ratio of R f to R to multiply this sum by a fixed constant. So, for exam-
ple, if the three voltages represented signals from three separate scales cal-
ibrated so that −1 V 1 lb, we could set R f = R/2.205 to obtain a voltage
signal that represented the combined weight in kilograms (to within about
1 percent accuracy due to our conversion factor).
Also, we notice that R L did not appear in our final expression. As long as its
value is not too low, the operation of the circuit will not be affected; at present,
we have not considered a detailed enough model of an op amp to predict such
an occurrence. This resistor represents the Thévenin equivalent of whatever we
use to monitor the amplifier output. If our output device is a simple voltmeter,
then R L represents the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen looking into the
voltmeter terminals (typically 10 M or more). Or, our output device might
be a speaker (typically 8 ), in which case we hear the sum of the three sepa-
rate sources of sound; v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 might represent microphones in that case.
One word of caution: It is frequently tempting to assume that the current
labeled i in Fig. 6.9 flows not only through R f but through R L also. Not true!
It is very possible that current is flowing through the output terminal of the
op amp as well, so that the currents through the two resistors are not the
same. It is for this reason that we almost universally avoid writing KCL
equations at the output pin of an op amp, which leads to the preference of
nodal over mesh analysis when working with most op amp circuits.
For convenience, we summarize the most common op amp circuits in
Table 1.

–PRACTICAL APPLICATION
A Fiber Optic Intercom
A point-to-point intercom system can be constructed
using a number of different approaches, depending on
the intended application environment. Low-power radio
frequency (RF) systems work very well and are gener-
ally cost-effective, but are subject to interference from
other RF sources and are also prone to eavesdropping.
Use of a simple wire to connect the two intercom sys-
tems instead can eliminate a great deal of the RF inter-
ference as well as increase privacy. However, wires are
subject to corrosion and short circuits when the plastic
insulation wears, and their weight can be a concern in
aircraft and related applications (Fig. 6.11).

An alternative design would be to convert the electri-
cal signal from the microphone to an optical signal,
which could then be transmitted through a thin (∼50 μm
diameter) optical fiber. The optical signal is then con-
verted back to an electrical signal, which is amplified
and delivered to a speaker. A schematic diagram of such
a system is shown in Fig. 6.12; two such systems would
be needed for two-way communication.

which is independent of the resistance of the LED. In or-
der to select values for R f and R 1 , we need to know the
input voltage from the microphone and the necessary
output voltage to power the LED. A quick measurement
indicates that the typical voltage output of the micro-
phone peaks at 40 mV when someone is using a normal
speaking voice. The LED manufacturer recommends op-
erating at approximately 1.6 V, so we design for a gain of
1.6/0.04 = 40. Arbitrarily choosing R 1 = 1 k leads to
a required value of 39 k for R f .
The circuit of Fig. 6.14 is the receiver part of our one-
way intercom system. It converts the optical signal from
the fiber into an electrical signal, amplifying it so that an
audible sound emanates from the speaker.

This circuit will work in practice, although the non-
linear characteristics of the LED lead to a noticeable dis-
tortion of the audio signal. We leave improved designs
for more advanced texts.
After coupling the LED output of the transmitting
circuit to the optical fiber, a signal of approximately
10 mV is measured from the photodetector. The speaker
is rated for a maximum of 100 mW and has an equivalent
resistance of 8 . This equates to a maximum speaker
voltage of 894 mV, so we need to select values of R 2 and
R 3 to obtain a gain of 894/10 = 89.4. With the arbitrary

Although the op amp is an extremely versatile device, there are numerous
applications in which a single op amp will not suffice. In such instances, it
is often possible to meet application requirements by cascading several in-
dividual op amps together in the same circuit. An example of this is shown
in Fig. 6.15, which consists of the summing amplifier circuit of Fig. 6.9 with
only two input sources, and the output fed into a simple inverting amplifier.
The result is a two-stage op amp circuit.

which describes the input-output characteristics of the circuit shown in
Fig. 6.15. We may not always be able to reduce such a circuit to familiar
stages, however, so it is worth seeing how the two-stage circuit of Fig. 6.15
can be analyzed as a whole.
When analyzing cascaded circuits, it is sometimes helpful to begin with
the last stage and work backward toward the input stage. Referring to ideal
op amp rule 1, the same current flows through R 1 and R 2 . Writing the appro-
priate nodal equation at the node labeled v c yields
0 =

Since our goal is an expression for v out in terms of v 1 and v 2 , we proceed
to the first op amp in order to obtain an expression for v x in terms of the two
input quantities.

[13]
We now have an equation for v out in terms of v x (Eq. [11]), and an equa-
tion for v x in terms of v 1 and v 2 (Eq. [13]). These equations are identical to
Eqs. [7] and [8], respectively, which means that cascading the two separate
circuits as in Fig. 6.15 did not affect the input-output relationship of either
stage. Combining Eqs. [11] and [13], we find that the input-output relation-
ship for the cascaded op amp circuit is
v out =
R 2 R f
(v 1 + v 2 )
R 1 R
[14]
which is identical to Eq. [9].
Thus, the cascaded circuit acts as a summing amplifier, but without a
phase reversal between the input and output. By choosing the resistor val-
ues carefully, we can either amplify or attenuate the sum of the two input
voltages. If we select R 2 = R 1 and R f = R, we can also obtain an amplifier
circuit where v out = v 1 + v 2 , if desired.

A multiple-tank gas propellant fuel system is installed in a small

We see from Table 6.2 that the system has three separate gas tanks,
requiring three separate sensors. Each sensor is rated up to 12,500 psia,
with a corresponding output of 5 V. Thus, when tank 1 is full, its sensor
will provide a voltage signal of 5 × (10,000/12,500) = 4 V; the
same is true for the sensor monitoring tank 2. The sensor connected
to tank 3, however, will only provide a maximum voltage signal of
5 × (2000͞12,500) 800 mV.
One possible solution is the circuit shown in Fig. 6.16a, which em-
ploys a summing amplifier stage with v 1 , v 2 , and v 3 representing the
three sensor outputs, followed by an inverting amplifier to adjust the
voltage sign and magnitude. Since we are not told the output resistance
of the sensor, we employ a buffer for each one as shown in Fig. 6.16b;
the result is (in the ideal case) no current flow from the sensor.
To keep the design as simple as possible, we begin by choosing
R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4 to be 1 k ; any value will do as long as all four
resistors are equal. Thus, the output of the summing stage is
v x = −(v 1 + v 2 + v 3 )
The final stage must invert this voltage and scale it such that the
output voltage is 1 V when all three tanks are full. The full condition
results in v x = −(4 + 4 + 0.8) = −8.8 V. Thus, the final stage needs
a voltage ratio of R 6 /R 5 = 1/8.8. Arbitrarily choosing R 6 = 1 k , we
find that a value of 8.8 k for R 5 completes the design.

CHAPTER 6 THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
6.4 CIRCUITS FOR VOLTAGE AND CURRENT SOURCES
•
In this and previous chapters we have often made use of ideal current and volt-
age sources, which we assume provide the same value of current or voltage, re-
spectively, regardless of how they are connected in a circuit. Our assumption
of independence has its limits, of course, as mentioned in Sec. 5.2 when we
discussed practical sources which included a “built-in” or inherent resistance.
The effect of such a resistance was a reduction of the voltage output of a volt-
age source as more current was demanded, or a diminished current output as
more voltage was required from a current source. As discussed in this section, it
is possible to construct circuits with more reliable characteristics using op amps.
A Reliable Voltage Source
One of the most common means of providing a stable and consistent refer-
ence voltage is to make use of a nonlinear device known as a Zener diode.
Its symbol is a triangle with a Z-like line across the top of the triangle, as
shown for a 1N750 in the circuit of Fig. 6.18a. Diodes are characterized by

a strongly asymmetric current-voltage relationship. For small voltages, they
either conduct essentially zero current—or experience an exponentially in-
creasing current—depending on the voltage polarity. In this way, they dis-
tinguish themselves from the simple resistor, where the magnitude of the
current is the same for either voltage polarity and hence the resistor current-
voltage relationship is symmetric. Consequently, the terminals of a diode
are not interchangeable, and have unique names: the anode (the flat part of
the triangle) and the cathode (the point of the triangle).
A Zener diode is a special type of diode designed to be used with a positive
voltage at the cathode with respect to the anode; when connected this way, the
diode is said to be reverse biased. For low voltages, the diode acts like a resis-
tor with a small linear increase in current flow as the voltage is increased. Once
a certain voltage (V BR ) is reached, however—known as the reverse breakdown
voltage or Zener voltage of the diode—the voltage does not significantly in-
crease further, but essentially any current can flow up to the maximum rating
of the diode (75 mA for a 1N750, whose Zener voltage is 4.7 V).
Let’s consider the simulation result presented in Fig. 6.18b, which shows
the voltage V ref across the diode as the voltage source V1 is swept from 0 to
20 V. Provided V1 remains above 5 V, the voltage across our diode is es-
sentially constant. Thus, we could replace V1 with a 9 V battery, and not be
too concerned with changes in our voltage reference as the battery voltage
begins to drop as it discharges. The purpose of R1 in this circuit is simply to
provide the necessary voltage drop between the battery and the diode; its
value should be chosen to ensure that the diode is operating at its Zener volt-
age but below its maximum rated current. For example, Fig. 6.18c shows
that the 75 mA rating is exceeded in our circuit if the source voltage V1 is
much greater than 12 V. Thus, the value of resistor R1 should be sized cor-
responding to the source voltage available, as we explore in Example 6.4.
EXAMPLE 6.4
Design a circuit based on the 1N750 Zener diode that runs on a
single 9 V battery and provides a reference voltage of 4.7 V.
The 1N750 has a maximum current rating of 75 mA, and a Zener volt-
age of 4.7 V. The voltage of a 9 V battery can vary slightly depending
on its state of charge, but we neglect this for the present design.
A simple circuit such as the one shown in Fig. 6.19a is adequate
for our purposes; the only issue is determining a suitable value for the
resistor R ref .
If 4.7 V is dropped across the diode, then 9 − 4.7 = 4.3 V must be
dropped across R ref . Thus,
R ref =
9 − V ref
4.3

I ref
I ref
We determine R ref by specifying a current value. We know that I ref
should not be allowed to exceed 75 mA for this diode, and large currents
will discharge the battery more quickly. However, as seen in Fig. 6.19b,
we cannot simply select I ref arbitrarily; very low currents do not allow

detailed equation for the diode’s current-voltage relationship (which is
clearly nonlinear), we design for 50 percent of the maximum rated cur-
rent as a rule of thumb. Thus,

Detailed “tweaking” can be obtained by performing a PSpice simu-
lation of the final circuit, although we see from Fig. 6.19c that our first
pass is reasonably close (within 1 percent) to our target value.
The basic Zener diode voltage reference circuit of Fig. 6.18a works very
well in many situations, but we are limited somewhat in the value of the volt-
age depending on which Zener diodes are available. Also, we often find that
the circuit shown is not well suited to applications requiring more than a few
milliamperes of current. In such instances, we may use the Zener reference
circuit in conjunction with a simple amplifier stage, as shown in Fig. 6.20.
The result is a stable voltage that can be controlled by adjusting the value of
either R 1 or R f , without having to switch to a different Zener diode.

ing we tap the output pin of the op amp. We can also use this circuit as a cur-
rent source, however, where R L represents a resistive load.

In other words, the current supplied to R L does not depend on its
resistance—the primary attribute of an ideal current source. It is also worth
noting that we are not tapping the output voltage of the op amp here as a quan-
tity of interest. Instead, we may view the load resistor R L as the Norton (or
Thévenin) equivalent of some unknown passive load circuit, which receives
power from the op amp circuit. Redrawing the circuit slightly as in Fig. 6.21b,
we see that it has a great deal in common with the more familiar circuit of
Fig. 6.21c. In other words, we may use this op amp circuit as an independent
current source with essentially ideal characteristics, up to the maximum rated
output current of the op amp selected.

battery and a 100 Ω resistor, we know from Fig. 6.18b that a voltage of
4.9 V will exist across the diode. Thus, V ref = 4.9 V, dictating a value of
4.9/10 −3 = 4.9 k for R ref . The complete circuit is shown in Fig. 6.22.
Note that if we had assumed a diode voltage of 4.7 V instead, the
error in our designed current would only be a few percent, well within
the typical 5 to 10 percent tolerance in resistor values we might expect.
The only issue remaining is whether 1 mA can in fact be provided to
any value of R L . For the case of R L 0, the output of the op amp will
be 4.9 V, which is not unreasonable. As the load resistor is increased,
however, the op amp output voltage increases. Eventually we must
reach some type of limit, as discussed in Sec. 6.5.

Reduced to its essentials, the op amp can be thought of as a voltage-
controlled dependent voltage source. The dependent voltage source provides
the output of the op amp, and the voltage on which it depends is applied to the
input terminals. A schematic diagram of a reasonable model for a practical
op amp is shown in Fig. 6.24; it includes a dependent voltage source with
voltage gain A, an output resistance R o , and an input resistance R i . Table 6.3
gives typical values for these parameters for several types of commercially
available op amps.
The parameter A is referred to as the open-loop voltage gain of the op amp,
and is typically in the range of 10 5 to 10 6 . We notice that all of the op amps
listed in Table 6.3 have extremely large open-loop voltage gain, especially
compared to the voltage gain of 11 that characterized the noninverting
amplifier circuit of Example 6.1. It is important to remember the distinction193

between the open-loop voltage gain of the op amp itself, and the closed-
loop voltage gain that characterizes a particular op amp circuit. The “loop”
in this case refers to an external path between the output pin and the invert-
ing input pin; it can be a wire, a resistor, or another type of element, de-
pending on the application.
The μA741 is a very common op amp, originally produced by Fairchild
Corporation in 1968. It is characterized by an open-loop voltage gain of
200,000, an input resistance of 2 M , and an output resistance of 75 . In
order to evaluate how well the ideal op amp model approximates the be-
havior of this particular device, let’s revisit the inverting amplifier circuit of
Fig. 6.3.
EXAMPLE 6.6
Using the appropriate values for the μA741 op amp in the model of
Fig. 6.24, reanalyze the inverting amplifie circuit of Fig. 6.3.
We begin by replacing the ideal op amp symbol of Fig. 6.3 with the
detailed model, resulting in the circuit shown in Fig. 6.25.
Note that we can no longer invoke the ideal op amp rules, since we are
not using the ideal op amp model. Thus, we write two nodal equations:

v out = −9.999448v in = −49.99724 sin 3t
mV
Upon comparing this to the expression found assuming an ideal op
amp (v out = −10v in = −50 sin 3t mV), we see that the ideal op amp is
indeed a reasonably accurate model. Further, assuming an ideal op amp
leads to a significant reduction in the algebra required to perform the
circuit analysis. Note that if we allow A → ∞, R o → 0, and R i → ∞,
Eq. [15] reduces to

and zero output resistance (R o ), derive an expression for v out in terms of
v in for the op amp circuit of Fig. 6.3.
Ans: v out /v in = −AR f R i /[(1 + A)R 1 R i + R 1 R f + R f R i ].
Derivation of the Ideal Op Amp Rules
We have seen that the ideal op amp can be a reasonably accurate model for
the behavior of practical devices. However, using our more detailed model
which includes a finite open-loop gain, finite input resistance, and nonzero
output resistance, it is actually straightforward to derive the two ideal op
amp rules.
Referring to Fig. 6.24, we see that the open circuit output voltage of a
practical op amp can be expressed as
v out = Av d
[16]SECTION 6.5 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Rearranging this equation, we find that v d , sometimes referred to as the
differential input voltage, can be written as
v d =
v out
A
[17]
As we might expect, there are practical limits to the output voltage v out
that can be obtained from a real op amp. As described in the next section, we
must connect our op amp to external dc voltage supplies in order to power the
internal circuitry. These external voltage supplies represent the maximum
value of v out , and are typically in the range of 5 to 24 V. If we divide 24 V by
the open-loop gain of the μA741 (2 × 10 5 ), we obtain v d = 120 μV.
Although this is not the same as zero volts, such a small value compared to
the output voltage of 24 V is practically zero. An ideal op amp would have in-
finite open-loop gain, resulting in v d = 0 regardless of v out ; this leads to ideal
op amp rule 2.
Ideal op amp rule 1 states that “No current ever flows into either input
terminal.” Referring to Fig. 6.23, the input current of an op amp is simply
i in =
v d
R i
We have just determined that v d is typically a very small voltage. As we
can see from Table 6.3, the input resistance of an op amp is very large, rang-
ing from the megaohms to the teraohms! Using the value of v d = 120 μV
from above and R i = 2 M , we compute an input current of 60 pA. This is
an extremely small current, and we would require a specialized ammeter
(known as a picoammeter) to measure it. We see from Table 6.3 that the typ-
ical input current (more accurately termed the input bias current) of a
μA741 is 80 nA, three orders of magnitude larger than our estimate. This is
a shortcoming of the op amp model we are using, which is not designed to
provide accurate values for input bias current. Compared to the other cur-
rents flowing in a typical op amp circuit, however, either value is essentially
zero. More modern op amps (such as the AD549) have even lower input
bias currents. Thus, we conclude that ideal op amp rule 1 is a fairly reason-
able assumption.
From our discussion, it is clear that an ideal op amp has infinite open-
loop voltage gain, and infinite input resistance. However, we have not yet
considered the output resistance of the op amp and its possible effects on
our circuit. Referring to Fig. 6.24, we see that
v out = Av d − R o i out
where i out flows from the output pin of the op amp. Thus, a nonzero value of
R o acts to reduce the output voltage, an effect which becomes more pro-
nounced as the output current increases. For this reason, an ideal op amp
has an output resistance of zero ohms. The μA741 has a maximum output
resistance of 75 , and more modern devices such as the AD549 have even
lower output resistance.
Common-Mode Rejection
The op amp is occasionally referred to as a difference amplifie , since the
output is proportional to the voltage difference between the two input

terminals. This means that if we apply identical voltages to both input
terminals, we expect the output voltage to be zero. This ability of the op
amp is one of its most attractive qualities, and is known as common-mode
rejection. The circuit shown in Fig. 6.26 is connected to provide an output
voltage
v out = v 2 − v 1
If v 1 = 2 + 3 sin 3t volts and v 2 = 2 volts, we would expect the output
to be −3 sin 3t volts; the 2 V component common to v 1 and v 2 would not
be amplified, nor does it appear in the output.
For practical op amps, we do in fact find a small contribution to the out-
put in response to common-mode signals. In order to compare one op amp
type to another, it is often helpful to express the ability of an op amp to reject
common-mode signals through a parameter known as the common-mode
rejection ratio, or CMRR. Defining v o CM as the output obtained when both
inputs are equal (v 1 = v 2 = v CM ), we can determine A CM , the common-
mode gain of the op amp
A CM =
v o CM
v CM
We then define CMRR in terms of the ratio of differential-mode gain A
to the common-mode gain A CM , or
CMRR ≡
A
A CM
[18]
although this is often expressed in decibels (dB), a logarithmic scale:
CMRR (dB) ≡ 20 log 10

[19]
Typical values for several different op amps are provided in Table 6.3;
a value of 100 dB corresponds to an absolute ratio of 10 5 for A to A CM .
Negative Feedback
We have seen that the open-loop gain of an op amp is very large, ideally in-
finite. In practical situations, however, its exact value can vary from the
value specified by the manufacturer as typical. Temperature, for example,
can have a number of significant effects on the performance of an op amp,
so that the operating behavior in −20 ◦ C weather may be significantly dif-
ferent from the behavior observed on a warm sunny day. Also, there are
typically small variations between devices fabricated at different times. If
we design a circuit in which the output voltage is the open-loop gain times
the voltage at one of the input terminals, the output voltage could therefore
be difficult to predict with a reasonable degree of precision, and might be
expected to change depending on the ambient temperature.
A solution to such potential problems is to employ the technique of
negative feedback, which is the process of subtracting a small portion of
the output from the input. If some event changes the characteristics of the
amplifier such that the output tries to increase, the input is decreasing at the
same time. Too much negative feedback will prevent any useful amplifica-
tion, but a small amount provides stability. An example of negative197
SECTION 6.5 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
feedback is the unpleasant sensation we feel as our hand draws near a
flame. The closer we move toward the flame, the larger the negative signal
sent from our hand. Overdoing the proportion of negative feedback, how-
ever, might cause us to abhor heat, and eventually freeze to death. Positive
feedback is the process where some fraction of the output signal is added
back to the input. A common example is when a microphone is directed to-
ward a speaker—a very soft sound is rapidly amplified over and over until
the system “screams.” Positive feedback generally leads to an unstable
system.
All of the circuits considered in this chapter incorporate negative feed-
back through the presence of a resistor between the output pin and the
inverting input. The resulting loop between the output and the input reduces
the dependency of the output voltage on the actual value of the open-loop
gain (as seen in Example 6.6). This obviates the need to measure the precise
open-loop gain of each op amp we use, as small variations in A will not sig-
nificantly impact the operation of the circuit. Negative feedback also pro-
vides increased stability in situations where A is sensitive to the op amp’s
surroundings. For example, if A suddenly increases in response to a change
in the ambient temperature, a larger feedback voltage is added to the
inverting input. This acts to reduce the differential input voltage v d , and
therefore the change in output voltage Av d is smaller. We should note that the
closed-loop circuit gain is always less than the open-loop device gain;
this is the price we pay for stability and reduced sensitivity to parameter
variations.
Saturation
So far, we have treated the op amp as a purely linear device, assuming that
its characteristics are independent of the way in which it is connected in a cir-
cuit. In reality, it is necessary to supply power to an op amp in order to run
the internal circuitry, as shown in Fig. 6.27. A positive supply, typically in the
range of 5 to 24 V dc, is connected to the terminal marked V + , and a nega-
tive supply of equal magnitude is connected to the terminal marked V − .
There are also a number of applications where a single voltage supply is
acceptable, as well as situations where the two voltage magnitudes may be
unequal. The op amp manufacturer will usually specify a maximum power
supply voltage, beyond which damage to the internal transistors will occur.
The power supply voltages are a critical choice when designing an op
amp circuit, because they represent the maximum possible output voltage of
the op amp. 3 For example, consider the op amp circuit shown in Fig. 6.26,
now connected as a noninverting amplifier having a gain of 10. As shown in
the PSpice simulation in Fig. 6.28, we do in fact observe linear behavior
from the op amp, but only in the range of ±1.71 V for the input voltage.
Outside of this range, the output voltage is no longer proportional to the
input, reaching a peak magnitude of 17.6 V. This important nonlinear effect
is known as saturation, which refers to the fact that further increases in the
input voltage do not result in a change in the output voltage. This phenom-
enon refers to the fact that the output of a real op amp cannot exceed its
(3) In practice, we find the maximum output voltage is slightly less than the supply voltage by as much as
a volt or so.

supply voltages. For example, if we choose to run the op amp with a +9 V
supply and a −5 V supply, then our output voltage will be limited to the
range of −5 to +9 V. The output of the op amp is a linear response bounded
by the positive and negative saturation regions, and as a general rule, we try
to design our op amp circuits so that we do not accidentally enter the satu-
ration region. This requires us to select the operating voltage carefully
based on the closed-loop gain and maximum expected input voltage.

As we are discovering, there are a number of practical considerations to
keep in mind when working with op amps. One particular nonideality worth
mentioning is the tendency for real op amps to have a nonzero output even
when the two input terminals are shorted together. The value of the output
under such conditions is known as the offset voltage, and the input voltage
required to reduce the output to zero is referred to as the input offset
voltage. Referring to Table 6.3, we see that typical values for the input offset
voltage are on the order of a few millivolts or less.
Most op amps are provided with two pins marked either “offset null” or
“balance.” These terminals can be used to adjust the output voltage by con-
necting them to a variable resistor. A variable resistor is a three-terminal de-
vice commonly used for such applications as volume controls on radios.
The device comes with a knob that can be rotated to select the actual value
of resistance, and has three terminals. Measured between the two extreme
terminals, its resistance is fixed regardless of the position of the knob. Us-
ing the middle terminal and one of the end terminals creates a resistor
whose value depends on the knob position. Figure 6.29 shows a typical cir-
cuit used to adjust the output voltage of an op amp; the manufacturer’s data
sheet may suggest alternative circuitry for a particular device.199
SECTION 6.5 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Slew Rate
Up to now, we have tacitly assumed that the op amp will respond equally
well to signals of any frequency, although perhaps we would not be sur-
prised to find that in practice there is some type of limitation in this regard.
Since we know that op amp circuits work well at dc, which is essentially
zero frequency, it is the performance as the signal frequency is increased
that we must consider. One measure of the frequency performance of an op
amp is its slew rate, which is the rate at which the output voltage can
respond to changes in the input; it is most often expressed in V/μs. The
typical slew rate specification for several commercially available devices is
provided in Table 6.3, showing values on the order of a few volts per
microsecond. One notable exception is the OPA690, which is designed as a
high-speed op amp for video applications requiring operation at several
hundred MHz. As can be seen, a respectable slew rate of 1800 V/μs is not
unrealistic for this device, although its other parameters, particularly input
bias current and CMRR, suffer somewhat as a result.
The PSpice simulations shown in Fig. 6.30 illustrate the degradation in
performance of an op amp due to slew rate limitations. The circuit simu-
lated is an LF411 configured as a noninverting amplifier with a gain of 2 and
powered by ±15 V supplies. The input waveform is shown in green, and has

a peak voltage of 1 V; the output voltage is shown in red. The simulation of
Fig. 6.30a corresponds to a rise and fall time of 1 μs which, although a
short time span for humans, is easily coped with by the LF411. As the rise
and fall times are decreased by a factor of 10 to 100 ns (Fig. 6.30b), we
begin to see that the LF411 is having a small difficulty in tracking the input.
In the case of a 50 ns rise and fall time (Fig. 6.30c), we see that not only is
there a significant delay between the output and the input, but the waveform
is noticeably distorted as well—not a good feature of an amplifier. This ob-
served behavior is consistent with the typical slew rate of 15 V/μs specified
in Table 6.3, which indicates that the output might be expected to require
roughly 130 ns to change from 0 to 2 V (or 2 V to 0 V).
Packaging
Modern op amps are available in a number of different types of packages.
Some styles are better suited to high temperatures, and there are a variety
of different ways to mount ICs on printed-circuit boards. Figure 6.31
shows several different styles of the LM741, manufactured by National
Semiconductor. The label “NC” next to a pin means “no connection.” The
package styles shown in the figure are standard configurations, and are used
for a large number of different integrated circuits; occasionally there are
more pins available on a package than required.

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
As we have just seen, PSpice can be enormously helpful in predicting
the output of an op amp circuit, especially in the case of time-varying
inputs. We will find, however, that our ideal op amp model agrees fairly
well with PSpice simulations as a general rule.
When performing a PSpice simulation of an op amp circuit, we must
be careful to remember that positive and negative dc supplies must be
connected to the device (with the exception of the LM324, which is de-
signed to be a single-supply op amp). Although the model shows the
offset null pins used to zero the output voltage, PSpice does not build in
any offset, so these pins are typically left floating (unconnected).
Table 6.3 shows the different op amp part numbers available in the
Evaluation version of PSpice; other models are available in the com-
mercial version of the software and from some manufacturers.SECTION 6.5 PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

EXAMPLE 6.7
Simulate the circuit of Fig. 6.3 using PSpice. Determine the point(s)
at which saturation begins if ±15 V dc supplies are used to power
the device. Compare the gain calculated by PSpice to what was
predicted using the ideal op amp model.
We begin by drawing the inverting amplifier circuit of Fig. 6.3 using
the schematic capture tool as shown in Fig. 6.32. Note that two separate
15 V dc supplies are required to power the op amp.
■ FIGURE 6.32 The inverting amplifier of Fig. 6.3 drawn using a μA741 op amp.
Our previous analysis using an ideal op amp model predicted a gain
of −10. With an input of 5 sin 3t mV, this led to an output voltage of
−50 sin 3t mV. However, an implicit assumption in the analysis was
that any voltage input would be amplified by a factor of −10. Based on
practical considerations, we expect this to be true for small input volt-
ages, but the output will eventually saturate to a value comparable to
the corresponding power supply voltage.
We perform a dc sweep from −2 to +2 volts, as shown in Fig. 6.33;
this is a slightly larger range than the supply voltage divided by the
gain, so we expect our results to include the positive and negative
saturation regions.
Using the cursor tool on the simulation results shown in
Fig. 6.34a, the input-output characteristic of the amplifier is indeed
linear over a wide input range, corresponding approximately to
−1.45 < Vs < +1.45 V (Fig. 6.34b): This range is slightly less than
the range defined by dividing the positive and negative supply voltages
by the gain. Outside this range, the output of the op amp saturates, with
only a slight dependence on the input voltage. In the two saturation re-
gions, then, the circuit does not perform as a linear amplifier.
Increasing the number of cursor digits (Tools, Options, Number of
Cursor Digits) to 10, we find that at an input voltage of Vs = 1.0 V, the

6.6 COMPARATORS AND THE INSTRUMENTATION
• AMPLIFIER
The Comparator
Every op amp circuit we have discussed up to now has featured an electri-
cal connection between the output pin and the inverting input pin. This is
known as closed-loop operation, and is used to provide negative feedback
as discussed previously. Closed loop is the preferred method of using an
op amp as an amplifier, as it serves to isolate the circuit performance from
variations in the open-loop gain that arise from changes in temperature or
manufacturing differences. There are a number of applications, however,
where it is advantageous to use an op amp in an open-loop configuration.
Devices intended for such applications are frequently referred to as
comparators, as they are designed slightly differently from regular op amps
in order to improve their speed in open-loop operation.
Figure 6.35a shows a simple comparator circuit where a 2.5 V refer-
ence voltage is connected to the noninverting input, and the voltage being
compared (v in ) is connected to the inverting input. Since the op amp has a
very large open-loop gain A (10 5 or greater, typically, as seen in Table 6.3),
it does not take a large voltage difference between the input terminals
to drive it into saturation. In fact, a differential input voltage as small as
the supply voltage divided by A is required—approximately ±120 μV in the
case of the circuit in Fig. 6.35a and A = 10 5 . The distinctive output of
the comparator circuit is shown in Fig. 6.35b, where the response swings

between positive and negative saturation, with essentially no linear
“amplification” region. Thus, a positive 12 V output from the comparator
indicates that the input voltage is less than the reference voltage, and a
negative 12 V output indicates an input voltage greater than the reference.
Opposite behavior is obtained if we connect the reference voltage to the
inverting input instead.

Since we want the output of our comparator to swing between 0 and
5 V, we will use an op amp with a single-ended +5 V supply, connected
as shown in Fig. 6.36. We connect a +3 V reference voltage to the
noninverting input, which may be provided by two 1.5 V batteries in
series, or a suitable Zener diode reference circuit. The input voltage
signal (designated v signal ) is then connected to the inverting input. In
reality, the saturation voltage range of a comparator circuit will be
slightly less than that of the supply voltages, so that some adjustment
may be required in conjunction with simulation or testing.

The Instrumentation Amplifier
The basic comparator circuit acts on the voltage difference between the two
input terminals to the device, although it does not technically amplify sig-
nals as the output is not proportional to the input. The difference amplifier
of Fig. 6.10 also acts on the voltage difference between the inverting and
noninverting inputs, and as long as care is taken to avoid saturation, does
provide an output directly proportional to this difference. When dealing
with a very small input voltage, however, a better alternative is a deviceSECTION 6.6 COMPARATORS AND THE INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIER
known as an instrumentation amplifie , which is actually three op amp
devices in a single package.
An example of the common instrumentation amplifier configuration is
shown in Fig. 6.38a, and its symbol is shown in Fig. 6.38b. Each input is fed
directly into a voltage follower stage, and the output of both voltage fol-
lowers is fed into a difference amplifier stage. It is particularly well suited
to applications where the input voltage signal is very small (for example, on
the order of millivolts), such as that produced by thermocouples or strain
gauges, and where a significant common-mode noise signal of several volts
may be present.

If components of the instrumentation amplifier are fabricated all on the
same silicon “chip,” then it is possible to obtain well-matched device char-
acteristics and to achieve precise ratios for the two sets of resistors. In order
to maximize the CMRR of the instrumentation amplifier, we expect
R 4 /R 3 = R 2 /R 1 , so that equal amplification of common-mode components
of the input signals is obtained. To explore this further, we identify the volt-
age at the output of the top voltage follower as “v − ,” and the voltage at the
output of the bottom voltage follower as “v + .” Assuming all three op amps
are ideal and naming the voltage at either input of the difference stage v x ,
we may write the following nodal equations:
v x − v −
v x − v out

= 0
R 1
R 2 [20]
v x − v +

and

v x =

[22]
and upon substituting into Eq. [20], obtain an expression for v out in terms of
the input:
v out =

[23]
From Eq. [23] it is clear that the general case allows amplification of
common-mode components to the two inputs. In the specific case where
205206
CHAPTER 6 THE OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER
R 4 /R 3 = R 2 /R 1 = K, however, Eq. [23] reduces to K(v + − v − ) = Kv d , so
that (asssuming ideal op amps) only the difference is amplified and the gain
is set by the resistor ratio. Since these resistors are internal to the instru-
mentation amplifier and not accessible to the user, devices such as the
AD622 allow the gain to be set anywhere in the range of 1 to 1000 by con-
necting an external resistor between two pins (shown as R G in Fig. 6.38b).
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In this chapter we introduced a new circuit element—a three-terminal
device—called the operational amplifier (or more commonly, the op amp).
In many circuit analysis situations it is approximated as an ideal device,
which leads to two rules that are applied. We studied several op amp circuits
in detail, including the inverting amplifie with gain R f ͞R 1 , the noninverting
amplifer with gain 1 ϩ R f ͞R 1 , and the summing amplifie . We were also
introduced to the voltage follower and the difference amplifie , although the
analysis of these two circuits was left for the reader. The concept of cas-
caded stages was found to be particularly useful, as it allows a design to be
broken down into distinct units, each of which has a specific function. We
took a slight detour and introduced briefly a two-terminal nonlinear circuit
element, the Zener diode, as it provides a practical and straightforward volt-
age reference. We then used this element to contruct practical voltage and
current sources using op amps, removing some of the mystery as to their
origins.
Modern op amps have nearly ideal characteristics, as we found when we
opted for a more detailed model based on a dependent source. Still, nonide-
alities are encountered occasionally, so we considered the role of negative
feedback in reducing the effect of temperature and manufacturing-related
variations in various parameters, common-mode rejection, and saturation.
One of the most interesting nonideal characteristics of any op amp is slew
rate. By simulating three different cases, we were able to see how the out-
put voltage can struggle to follow the form of the input voltage signal once
its frequency becomes high enough. We concluded the chapter with two
special cases: the comparator, which intentionally makes use of our ability
to saturate a practical (nonideal) op amp, and the instrumentation amplifier,
which is routinely used to amplify very small voltages.
This is a good point to pause, take a breath, and recap some of the key
points. At the same time, we will highlight relevant examples as an aid to
the reader.
❑
❑
❑
There are two fundamental rules that must be applied when analyzing
ideal op amp circuits:
1. No current ever flows into either input terminal. (Example 6.1)
2. No voltage ever exists between the input terminals.
Op amp circuits are usually analyzed for an output voltage in terms of
some input quantity or quantities. (Examples 6.1, 6.2)
Nodal analysis is typically the best choice in analyzing op amp
circuits, and it is usually better to begin at the input, and work toward
the output. (Examples 6.1, 6.2)READING FURTHER
❑
❑
The output current of an op amp cannot be assumed; it must be
found after the output voltage has been determined independently.
(Example 6.2)
The gain of an inverting op amp circuit is given by the equation
v out = −

The gain of a noninverting op amp circuit is given by the equation
v out = 1 +

(Example 6.1)
Cascaded stages may be analyzed one stage at a time to relate the
output to the input. (Example 6.3)
Zener diodes provide a convenient voltage reference. They are not
symmetric, however, meaning the two terminals are not
interchangeable. (Example 6.4)
Op amps can be used to construct current sources which are
independent of the load resistance over a specific current range.
(Example 6.5)
A resistor is almost always connected from the output pin of an op amp
to its inverting input pin, which incorporates negative feedback into
the circuit for increased stability.
The ideal op amp model is based on the approximation of infinite
open-loop gain A, infinite input resistance R i , and zero output
resistance R o . (Example 6.6)
In practice, the output voltage range of an op amp is limited by the
supply voltages used to power the device. (Example 6.7)
Comparators are op amps designed to be driven into saturation. These
circuits operate in open loop, and hence have no external feedback
resistor. (Example 6.8)

analog signals into digital signals. Design a circuit that acts as a simple 1-bit

greater than 1.5 V resulting in a logic “1.”
56. A common application for instrumentation amplifiers is to measure
voltages in resistive strain gauge circuits. These strain sensors work by
exploiting the changes in resistance that result from geometric distortions, as

height of 5 meters at a flow rate of 100 l/s. A variable position valve in line
with the water supply to the fountain can be controlled electrically, such that
0 V applied results in the valve being fully open, and 5 V results in the valve
being closed. In adverse wind conditions the maximum height of the fountain
needs to be adjusted; if the wind velocity exceeds 50 km/h, the height cannot
exceed 2 meters. A wind velocity sensor is available which provides a voltage

Capacitors and

Inductors
KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we introduce two new passive circuit elements, the
capacitor and the inductor, each of which has the ability to both
store and deliver finit amounts of energy. They differ from ideal
sources in this respect, since they cannot sustain a finite average
power flow over an infinite time interval. Although they are classed
as linear elements, the current-voltage relationships for these new
elements are time-dependent, leading to many interesting circuits.
The range of capacitance and inductance values we might encounter
can be huge, so that at times they may dominate circuit behavior,
and at other times be essentially insignificant. Such issues continue
to be relevant in modern circuit applications, particularly as com-
puter and communication systems move to increasingly higher
operating frequencies and component densities.
7.1 THE CAPACITOR
•
Ideal Capacitor Model
Previously, we termed independent and dependent sources active
elements, and the linear resistor a passive element, although our de-
finitions of active and passive are still slightly fuzzy and need to be
brought into sharper focus. We now define an active element as an
element that is capable of furnishing an average power greater than
zero to some external device, where the average is taken over an
infinite time interval. Ideal sources are active elements, and the
operational amplifier is also an active device. A passive element,
however, is defined as an element that cannot supply an average
power that is greater than zero over an infinite time interval. The
resistor falls into this category; the energy it receives is usually
transformed into heat, and it never supplies energy.

where v and i satisfy the conventions for a passive element, as shown in
Fig. 7.1. We should bear in mind that v and i are functions of time; if
needed, we can emphasize this fact by writing v(t) and i(t) instead. From
Eq. [1], we may determine the unit of capacitance as an ampere-second per
volt, or coulomb per volt. We will now define the farad 1 (F) as one coulomb
per volt, and use this as our unit of capacitance.
The ideal capacitor defined by Eq. [1] is only a mathematical model of a
real device. A capacitor consists of two conducting surfaces on which
charge may be stored, separated by a thin insulating layer that has a very
large resistance. If we assume that this resistance is sufficiently large that it
may be considered infinite, then equal and opposite charges placed on the
capacitor “plates” can never recombine, at least by any path within the ele-
ment. The construction of the physical device is suggested by the circuit
symbol shown in Fig. 7.1.
Let us visualize some external device connected to this capacitor and
causing a positive current to flow into one plate of the capacitor and out of
the other plate. Equal currents are entering and leaving the two terminals,
and this is no more than we expect for any circuit element. Now let us ex-
amine the interior of the capacitor. The positive current entering one plate
represents positive charge moving toward that plate through its terminal
lead; this charge cannot pass through the interior of the capacitor, and it
therefore accumulates on the plate. As a matter of fact, the current and the
increasing charge are related by the familiar equation
i =
dq
dt
Now let us consider this plate as an overgrown node and apply Kirchhoff’s
current law. It apparently does not hold; current is approaching the plate
from the external circuit, but it is not flowing out of the plate into the
“internal circuit.” This dilemma bothered a famous Scottish scientist, James
Clerk Maxwell, more than a century ago. The unified electromagnetic the-
ory that he subsequently developed hypothesizes a “displacement current”
that is present wherever an electric field or a voltage is varying with time.
The displacement current flowing internally between the capacitor plates is
exactly equal to the conduction current flowing in the capacitor leads;
Kirchhoff’s current law is therefore satisfied if we include both conduction
and displacement currents. However, circuit analysis is not concerned with
this internal displacement current, and since it is fortunately equal to the
conduction current, we may consider Maxwell’s hypothesis as relating the
conduction current to the changing voltage across the capacitor.
A capacitor constructed of two parallel conducting plates of area A,
separated by a distance d, has a capacitance C = ε A/d, where ε is the permit-
tivity, a constant of the insulating material between the plates; this assumes

rated electrolytic, 55 F 2.5 VDC rated electrolytic, and 4800 μF 50 VDC rated electrolytic. Note that generally speaking larger capacitance values require larger packages,
with one notable exception above. What was the tradeoff in that case?
the linear dimensions of the conducting plates are all very much greater
than d. For air or vacuum, ε = ε 0 = 8.854 pF/m. Most capacitors employ a
thin dielectric layer with a larger permittivity than air in order to minimize the
device size. Examples of various types of commercially available capacitors
are shown in Fig. 7.2, although we should remember that any two conducting
surfaces not in direct contact with each other may be characterized by a
nonzero (although probably small) capacitance. We should also note that a
capacitance of several hundred microfarads (μF) is considered “large.”
Several important characteristics of our new mathematical model can be
discovered from the defining equation, Eq. [1]. A constant voltage across a
capacitor results in zero current passing through it; a capacitor is thus an
“open circuit to dc.” This fact is pictorially represented by the capacitor
symbol. It is also apparent that a sudden jump in the voltage requires an in-
finite current. Since this is physically impossible, we will therefore prohibit
the voltage across a capacitor to change in zero time.

Integral Voltage-Current Relationships
The capacitor voltage may be expressed in terms of the current by integrat-
ing Eq. [1]. We first obtain

ing voltages v(t 0 ) and v(t):
v(t) =

i(t ) dt + v(t 0 )
[2]
Equation [2] may also be written as an indefinite integral plus a constant
of integration:

i dt + k
(2) Note that we are employing the mathematically correct procedure of defining a dummy variable t in
situations where the integration variable t is also a limit.SECTION 7.1 THE CAPACITOR
221
Finally, in many situations we will find that v(t 0 ), the voltage initially
across the capacitor, is not able to be discerned. In such instances it is
mathematically convenient to set t 0 = −∞ and v(−∞) = 0, so that
v(t) =
1
C

Since the integral of the current over any time interval is the correspond-
ing charge accumulated on the capacitor plate into which the current is
flowing, we may also define capacitance as
q(t) = Cv(t)
where q(t) and v(t) represent instantaneous values of the charge on either
plate and the voltage between the plates, respectively.

Equation [2] is the appropriate expression here:
1 t
i(t ) dt + v(t 0 )
v(t) =

but now it needs to be interpreted graphically. To do this, we note that
the difference in voltage between times t and t 0 is proportional to the
area under the current curve defined by the same two times. The con-
stant of proportionality is 1/C.
From Fig. 7.5a, we see three separate intervals: t ≤ 0, 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 ms,
and t ≥ 2 ms. Defining the first interval more specifically as between
−∞ and 0, so that t 0 = −∞, we note two things, both a consequence
of the fact that the current has always been zero up to t = 0: First,
v(t 0 ) = v(−∞) = 0
Second, the integral of the current between t 0 = −∞ and 0 is simply
zero, since i = 0 in that interval. Thus,
v(t) = 0 + v(−∞)
−∞ ≤ t ≤ 0
or
v(t) = 0
t ≤ 0

is once again zero, so that

and thus

[3]
where the stored energy is w C (t 0 ) in joules (J) and the voltage at t 0 is v(t 0 ).
If we select a zero-energy reference at t 0 , implying that the capacitor volt-
age is also zero at that instant, then
w C (t) = 12 Cv 2
[4]
Let us consider a simple numerical example. As sketched in Fig. 7.7, a
sinusoidal voltage source is in parallel with a 1 M resistor and a 20 μF
capacitor. The parallel resistor may be assumed to represent the finite resis-
tance of the dielectric between the plates of the physical capacitor (an ideal
capacitor has infinite resistance).223

the energy dissipated in the resistor over the interval 0 < t < 0.5 s.
᭤ Identify the goal of the problem.
The energy stored in the capacitor varies with time; we are asked for
the maximum value over a specific time interval. We are also asked to
find the total amount of energy dissipated by the resistor over this in-
terval. These are actually two completely different questions.
᭤ Collect the known information.
The only source of energy in the circuit is the independent voltage
source, which has a value of 100 sin 2πt V. We are only interested in
the time interval of 0 < t < 0.5 s. The circuit is properly labeled.

᭤ Attempt a solution.
From our sketch of the expression for the energy stored in the capaci-
tor, we see that it increases from zero at t = 0 to a maximum of
100 mJ at t = 14 s, and then decreases to zero in another 14 s. Thus,
w C max = 100 mJ. Evaluating our integral expression for the energy
dissipated in the resistor, we find that w R = 2.5 mJ.
(Continued on next page)CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
We do not expect to calculate a negative stored energy, which is borne out
in our sketch. Further, since the maximum value of sin 2πt is 1, the maxi-
mum energy expected anywhere would be (1/2)(20 × 10 −6 )(100) 2 =
100 mJ.
The resistor dissipated 2.5 mJ in the period of 0 to 500 ms,
although the capacitor stored a maximum of 100 mJ at one point
during that interval. What happened to the “other” 97.5 mJ? To
answer this, we compute the capacitor current
i C = 20 × 10 −6
dv
= 0.004π cos 2πt
dt
and the current i s defined as flowing into the voltage source
i s = −i C − i R
both of which are plotted in Fig. 7.9. We observe that the current flow-
ing through the resistor is a small fraction of the source current, not
entirely surprising as 1 M is a relatively large resistance value. As
current flows from the source, a small amount is diverted to the
resistor, with the rest flowing into the capacitor as it charges. After
t = 250 ms, the source current is seen to change sign; current is now
flowing from the capacitor back into the source. Most of the energy
stored in the capacitor is being returned to the ideal voltage source,
except for the small fraction dissipated in the resistor.

SECTION 7.2 THE INDUCTOR
Important Characteristics of an Ideal Capacitor
1. There is no current through a capacitor if the voltage across it is not
changing with time. A capacitor is therefore an open circuit to dc.
2. A finite amount of energy can be stored in a capacitor even if the
current through the capacitor is zero, such as when the voltage
across it is constant.
3. It is impossible to change the voltage across a capacitor by a finite
amount in zero time, as this requires an infinite current through the
capacitor. (A capacitor resists an abrupt change in the voltage
across it in a manner analogous to the way a spring resists an
abrupt change in its displacement.)
4. A capacitor never dissipates energy, but only stores it. Although
this is true for the mathematical model, it is not true for a physical
capacitor due to finite resistances associated with the dielectric as
well as the packaging.
7.2 THE INDUCTOR
•
Ideal Inductor Model
In the early 1800s the Danish scientist Oersted showed that a current-
carrying conductor produced a magnetic field (compass needles were
affected in the presence of a wire when current was flowing). Shortly there-
after, Ampère made some careful measurements which demonstrated that
this magnetic field was linearly related to the current which produced it.
The next step occurred some 20 years later when the English experimental-
ist Michael Faraday and the American inventor Joseph Henry discovered
almost simultaneously 3 that a changing magnetic field could induce a volt-
age in a neighboring circuit. They showed that this voltage was proportional
to the time rate of change of the current producing the magnetic field. The
constant of proportionality is what we now call the inductance, symbolized
by L, and therefore
v = L
di
dt
[5]
where we must realize that v and i are both functions of time. When we wish
to emphasize this, we may do so by using the symbols v(t) and i(t).
The circuit symbol for the inductor is shown in Fig. 7.10, and it should
be noted that the passive sign convention is used, just as it was with the re-
sistor and the capacitor. The unit in which inductance is measured is the
henry (H), and the defining equation shows that the henry is just a shorter
expression for a volt-second per ampere.

CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
The inductor whose inductance is defined by Eq. [5] is a mathematical
model; it is an ideal element which we may use to approximate the behavior
of a real device. A physical inductor may be constructed by winding a
length of wire into a coil. This serves effectively to increase the current that
is causing the magnetic field and also to increase the “number” of neigh-
boring circuits into which Faraday’s voltage may be induced. The result of
this twofold effect is that the inductance of a coil is approximately propor-
tional to the square of the number of complete turns made by the conduc-
tor out of which it is formed. For example, an inductor or “coil” that has the
form of a long helix of very small pitch is found to have an inductance of
μN 2 A/s, where A is the cross-sectional area, s is the axial length of the he-
lix, N is the number of complete turns of wire, and μ (mu) is a constant of
the material inside the helix, called the permeability. For free space (and
very closely for air), μ = μ 0 = 4π × 10 −7 H/m = 4π nH/cm. Several ex-
amples of commercially available inductors are shown in Fig. 7.11.
Let us now scrutinize Eq. [5] to determine some of the electrical charac-
teristics of the mathematical model. This equation shows that the voltage
across an inductor is proportional to the time rate of change of the current
through it. In particular, it shows that there is no voltage across an inductor
carrying a constant current, regardless of the magnitude of this current.
Accordingly, we may view an inductor as a short circuit to dc.
Another fact that can be obtained from Eq. [5] is that a sudden or dis-
continuous change in the current must be associated with an infinite voltage
across the inductor. In other words, if we wish to produce an abrupt change
in an inductor current, we must apply an infinite voltage. Although an
infinite-voltage forcing function might be amusing theoretically, it can
never be a part of the phenomena displayed by a real physical device. As we

shall see shortly, an abrupt change in the inductor current also requires an
abrupt change in the energy stored in the inductor, and this sudden change
in energy requires infinite power at that instant; infinite power is again not a
part of the real physical world. In order to avoid infinite voltage and infinite
power, an inductor current must not be allowed to jump instantaneously
from one value to another.
If an attempt is made to open-circuit a physical inductor through which
a finite current is flowing, an arc may appear across the switch. This is use-
ful in the ignition system of some automobiles, where the current through
the spark coil is interrupted by the distributor and the arc appears across the
spark plug. Although this does not occur instantaneously, it happens in a
very short timespan, leading to the creation of a large voltage. The pres-
ence of a large voltage across a short distance equates to a very large
electric field; the stored energy is dissipated in ionizing the air in the path
of the arc.
Equation [5] may also be interpreted (and solved, if necessary) by
graphical methods, as seen in Example 7.4.

Since the current is zero for t < −1 s, the voltage is zero in this inter-
val. The current then begins to increase at the linear rate of 1 A/s, and
thus a constant voltage of L di/dt = 3 V is produced. During the
following 2 s interval, the current is constant and the voltage is there-
fore zero. The final decrease of the current results in di/dt = −1 A/s,
yielding v = −3 V. For t > 3 s, i(t) is a constant (zero), so that
v(t) = 0 for that interval. The complete voltage waveform is sketched

ing to note that the area under each voltage pulse is 3 V · s.

current will cause the infinite voltage “spikes” (each having an area of

the equally valid but opposite point of view, these infinite voltage spikes are

Integral Voltage-Current Relationships

and we have been able to draw several conclusions about the characteristics
of an inductor from this relationship. For example, we have found that we
may consider an inductor to be a short circuit to direct current, and we have
agreed that we cannot permit an inductor current to change abruptly from
one value to another, because this would require that an infinite voltage and
power be associated with the inductor. The simple defining equation for
inductance contains still more information, however. Rewritten in a slightly
different form,

it invites integration. Let us first consider the limits to be placed on the two
integrals. We desire the current i at time t, and this pair of quantities there-
fore provides the upper limits on the integrals appearing on the left and right
sides of the equation, respectively; the lower limits may also be kept general
by merely assuming that the current is i(t 0 ) at time t 0 . Thus,

also possible for the latter equation. We may write the integral as an indefi-
nite integral and include a constant of integration k:

i(t) =

[7]
We also may assume that we are solving a realistic problem in which the
selection of t 0 as −∞ ensures no current or energy in the inductor. Thus, if
i(t 0 ) = i(−∞) = 0, then

Let us investigate the use of these several integrals by working a simple
example where the voltage across an inductor is specified.

i(t) =
The first term indicates that the inductor current varies sinusoidally;
the second and third terms together represent a constant which becomes
known when the current is numerically specified at some instant of
time. Using the fact that the current is 1 A at t = −π/2 s, we identify t 0
as −π/2 with i(t 0 ) = 1, and find that
i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t − 0.6 sin(−2.5π) + 1
or
i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t + 1.6
Alternatively, from Eq. [6],
i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t + k
and we establish the numerical value of k by forcing the current to be
1 A at t = −π/2:
1 = 0.6 sin(−2.5π) + k
or
k = 1 + 0.6 = 1.6
and so, as before,
i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t + 1.6SECTION 7.2 THE INDUCTOR
Equation [8] is going to cause trouble with this particular voltage.
We based the equation on the assumption that the current was zero
when t = −∞. To be sure, this must be true in the real, physical world,
but we are working in the land of the mathematical model; our ele-
ments and forcing functions are all idealized. The difficulty arises after
we integrate, obtaining
i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t
t

and attempt to evaluate the integral at the lower limit:
i(t) = 0.6 sin 5t − 0.6 sin(−∞)
The sine of ±∞ is indeterminate, and therefore we cannot evaluate
our expression. Equation [8] is only useful if we are evaluating func-
tions which approach zero as t → −∞.

We should not make any snap judgments, however, as to which single
form of Eqs. [6], [7], and [8] we are going to use forever after; each has its
advantages, depending on the problem and the application. Equation [6]
represents a long, general method, but it shows clearly that the constant of
integration is a current. Equation [7] is a somewhat more concise expression
of Eq. [6], but the nature of the integration constant is suppressed. Finally,
Eq. [8] is an excellent expression, since no constant is necessary; however,
it applies only when the current is zero at t = −∞ and when the analytical
expression for the current is not indeterminate there.
Energy Storage
Let us now turn our attention to power and energy. The absorbed power is
given by the current-voltage product
p = vi = Li
di
dt
The energy w L accepted by the inductor is stored in the magnetic field
around the coil. The change in this energy is expressed by the integral of the
power over the desired time interval:

CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
where we have again assumed that the current is i(t 0 ) at time t 0 . In using the
energy expression, it is customary to assume that a value of t 0 is selected at
which the current is zero; it is also customary to assume that the energy is
zero at this time. We then have simply
w L (t) = 12 Li 2
[10]
where we now understand that our reference for zero energy is any time at
which the inductor current is zero. At any subsequent time at which the cur-
rent is zero, we also find no energy stored in the coil. Whenever the current
is not zero, and regardless of its direction or sign, energy is stored in the in-
ductor. It follows, therefore, that energy may be delivered to the inductor for
a part of the time and recovered from the inductor later. All the stored
energy may be recovered from an ideal inductor; there are no storage
charges or agent’s commissions in the mathematical model. A physical coil,
however, must be constructed out of real wire and thus will always have a
resistance associated with it. Energy can no longer be stored and recovered
without loss.
These ideas may be illustrated by a simple example. In Fig. 7.16, a 3 H
inductor is shown in series with a 0.1 resistor and a sinusoidal current
source, i s = 12 sin πt 6 A. The resistor should be interpreted as the resistance
of the wire which must be associated with the physical coil.

and this energy increases from zero at t = 0 to 216 J at t = 3 s. Thus,
the maximum energy stored in the inductor is 216 J.
After reaching its peak value at t = 3 s, the energy has completely
left the inductor 3 s later. Let us see what price we have paid in this coil
for the privilege of storing and removing 216 J in these 6 seconds. The

this large an inductance. For coils having an inductance of about

Ans: −15.06 mV; 24.0 A; 7.49 μW; 0.510 μJ.
We summarize by listing four key characteristics of an inductor which
result from its defining equation v = L di/dt :
Important Characteristics of an Ideal Inductor
1. There is no voltage across an inductor if the current through it is
not changing with time. An inductor is therefore a short circuit
to dc.
2. A finite amount of energy can be stored in an inductor even if
the voltage across the inductor is zero, such as when the current
through it is constant.
3. It is impossible to change the current through an inductor by a
finite amount in zero time, for this requires an infinite voltage
across the inductor. (An inductor resists an abrupt change in the
current through it in a manner analogous to the way a mass resists
an abrupt change in its velocity.)
4. The inductor never dissipates energy, but only stores it. Although
this is true for the mathematical model, it is not true for a physical
inductor due to series resistances.
It is interesting to anticipate our discussion of duality in Sec. 7.6 by
rereading the previous four statements with certain words replaced by their
“duals.” If capacitor and inductor, capacitance and inductance, voltage and
current, across and through, open circuit and short circuit, spring and mass,
and displacement and velocity are interchanged (in either direction), the
four statements previously given for capacitors are obtained.
233PRACTICAL APPLICATION
In Search of the Missing Element
So far, we have been introduced to three different two-
terminal passive elements: the resistor, the capacitor,
and the inductor. Each has been defined in terms of
its current-voltage relationship (v = Ri, i = C dv/dt ,
and v = L di/dt , respectively). From a more fundamen-
tal perspective, however, we can view these three ele-
ments as part of a larger picture relating four basic
quantities, namely, charge q, current i , voltage v, and flux
linkage φ. Charge, current, and voltage are discussed in
Chap. 2. Flux linkage is the product of magnetic flux and
the number of turns of conducting wire linked by the flux,
and it can be expressed in terms of the voltage v across
the coil as φ = v dt or v = dφ/dt .

Figure 7.17 graphically represents how these four
quantities are interrelated. First, apart from any circuit
elements and their characteristics, we have dq = i dt
(Chap. 2) and now dφ = v dt. Charge is related to volt-
age in the context of a capacitor, since C = dq/dv or
dq = C dv. The element we call a resistor provides a
direct relationship between voltage and current, which for
consistency can be expressed as dv = R di . Continuing
our counterclockwise journey around the perimeter of
Fig. 7.17, we note that our original expression connecting
the voltage and current associated with an inductor can be
written in terms of current i and flux linkage φ, since
rearranging yields v dt = L di , and we know dφ = v dt.
Thus, for the inductor, we can write dφ = L di .
So far, we have traveled from q to v with the aid of a
capacitor, v to i using the resistor, and i to φ using the
inductor. However, we have not yet used any element to
connect φ and q, although symmetry suggests such a
thing should be possible. In the early 1970s, Leon Chua
found himself thinking along these lines, and postulated a
new device—a “missing” two-terminal circuit element—
and named it the memristor. 1 He went on to demonstrate
that the electrical characteristics of a memristor should
be nonlinear, and depend on its history—in other words,
a memristor might be characterized by having a memory
(hence its name). Independent of his work, others had
proposed a similar device, not so much for its practical
use in real circuits, but for its potential in device model-
ing and signal processing.
Not a great deal was heard of this hypothetical
element afterward, at least until Dmitri Strukov and
coworkers at HP Labs in Palo Alto published a short
paper in 2008 claiming to have “found” the memristor. 2
They offer several reasons why it took almost four
decades to realize the general type of device Chua
hypothesized in 1971, but one of the most interesting has
to do with size. In making their prototype memristor,
nanotechnology (the art of fabricating devices with at
least one dimension less than 1000 nm, which is approx-
imately 1% of the diameter of human hair) played a key
role. A 5 nm thick oxide layer sandwiched between
platinum electrodes comprises the entire device. The
nonlinear electrical characteristics of the prototype
immediately generated considerable excitement, most
notably for its potential applications in integrated cir-
cuits, where devices are already approaching their small-
est realistic size; and many believe new types of devices
will be required to further extend integrated circuit
density and functionality. Whether the memristor is the
circuit element that will allow this remains to be seen—
despite the report of a prototype, there remains much
work to be done before it becomes practical.

7.3 INDUCTANCE AND CAPACITANCE
• COMBINATIONS
Now that we have added the inductor and capacitor to our list of passive cir-
cuit elements, we need to decide whether or not the methods we have de-
veloped for resistive circuit analysis are still valid. It will also be convenient
to learn how to replace series and parallel combinations of either of these
elements with simpler equivalents, just as we did with resistors in Chap. 3.
We look first at Kirchhoff’s two laws, both of which are axiomatic.
However, when we hypothesized these two laws, we did so with no restric-
tions as to the types of elements constituting the network. Both, therefore,
remain valid.
Inductors in Series
Now we may extend the procedures we have derived for reducing various
combinations of resistors into one equivalent resistor to the analogous cases
of inductors and capacitors. We shall first consider an ideal voltage source
applied to the series combination of N inductors, as shown in Fig. 7.18a.
We desire a single equivalent inductor, with inductance L eq , which may re-
place the series combination so that the source current i(t) is unchanged.

and it is no great source of amazement to note that capacitors in parallel
combine in the same manner in which we combine resistors in series, that
is, by simply adding all the individual capacitances.
These formulas are well worth memorizing. The formulas applying to se-
ries and parallel combinations of inductors are identical to those for resistors,
so they typically seem “obvious.” Care should be exercised, however, in the
case of the corresponding expressions for series and parallel combinations of
capacitors, as they are opposite those of resistors and inductors, frequently
leading to errors when calculations are made too hastily.

7.4 CONSEQUENCES OF LINEARITY
•
Next let us turn to nodal and mesh analysis. Since we already know that we
may safely apply Kirchhoff’s laws, we can apply them in writing a set of
equations that are both sufficient and independent. They will be constant-
coefficient linear integrodifferential equations, however, which are hard
enough to pronounce, let alone solve. Consequently, we shall write them
now to gain familiarity with the use of Kirchhoff’s laws in RLC circuits and
discuss the solution of the simpler cases in subsequent chapters.

These are the promised integrodifferential equations, and we note
several interesting points about them. First, the source voltage v s happens
to enter the equations as an integral and as a derivative, but not simply
as v s . Since both sources are specified for all time, we should be able to
evaluate the derivative or integral. Second, the initial value of the induc-
tor current, i L (t 0 ), acts as a (constant) source current at the center node.239

We will not attempt the solution of integrodifferential equations here. It is
worthwhile pointing out, however, that when the voltage forcing functions are
sinusoidal functions of time, it will be possible to define a voltage-current
ratio (called impedance) or a current-voltage ratio (called admittance) for
each of the three passive elements. The factors operating on the two node
voltages in the preceding equations will then become simple multiplying fac-
tors, and the equations will be linear algebraic equations once again. These we
may solve by determinants or a simple elimination of variables as before.
We may also show that the benefits of linearity apply to RLC circuits as
well. In accordance with our previous definition of a linear circuit, these
circuits are also linear because the voltage-current relationships for the
inductor and capacitor are linear relationships. For the inductor, we have
di
v = L
dt
and multiplication of the current by some constant K leads to a voltage that
is also greater by a factor K. In the integral formulation,
1 t
v dt + i(t 0 )
i(t) =
L t 0
it can be seen that, if each term is to increase by a factor of K, then the ini-
tial value of the current must also increase by this same factor.
A corresponding investigation of the capacitor shows that it, too, is lin-
ear. Thus, a circuit composed of independent sources, linear dependent
sources, and linear resistors, inductors, and capacitors is a linear circuit.
In this linear circuit the response is again proportional to the forcing
function. The proof of this statement is accomplished by first writing a
general system of integrodifferential equations. Let us place all the terms
having the form of Ri, L di/dt, and 1/C i dt on the left side of each
equation, and keep the independent source voltages on the right side. As a
simple example, one of the equations might have the form
di
1 t
i dt + v C (t 0 ) = v s
Ri + L
+
dt
C t 0
If every independent source is now increased by a factor K, then the
right side of each equation is greater by the factor K. Now each term on the
left side is either a linear term involving some loop current or an initial
capacitor voltage. In order to cause all the responses (loop currents) to in-
crease by a factor K, it is apparent that we must also increase the initial
capacitor voltages by a factor K. That is, we must treat the initial capacitor
voltage as an independent source voltage and increase it also by a factor K.
In a similar manner, initial inductor currents appear as independent source
currents in nodal analysis.
The principle of proportionality between source and response can thus
be extended to the general RLC circuit, and it follows that the principle of
superposition also applies. It should be emphasized that initial inductor

CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
currents and capacitor voltages must be treated as independent sources in
applying the superposition principle; each initial value must take its turn
in being rendered inactive. In Chap. 5 we learned that the principle of
superposition is a natural consequence of the linear nature of resistive
circuits. The resistive circuits are linear because the voltage-current rela-
tionship for the resistor is linear and Kirchhoff’s laws are linear.
Before we can apply the superposition principle to RLC circuits, how-
ever, it is first necessary to develop methods of solving the equations
describing these circuits when only one independent source is present. At
this time we should feel convinced that a linear circuit will possess a re-
sponse whose amplitude is proportional to the amplitude of the source. We
should be prepared to apply superposition later, considering an inductor
current or capacitor voltage specified at t = t 0 as a source that must be
deactivated when its turn comes.
Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems are based on the linearity of the ini-
tial circuit, the applicability of Kirchhoff’s laws, and the superposition prin-
ciple. The general RLC circuit conforms perfectly to these requirements,
and it follows, therefore, that all linear circuits that contain any combina-
tions of independent voltage and current sources, linear dependent voltage
and current sources, and linear resistors, inductors, and capacitors may be
analyzed with the use of these two theorems, if we wish.

In Chap. 6 we were introduced to several different types of amplifier circuits
based on the ideal op amp. In almost every case, we found that the output was
related to the input voltage by some combination of resistance ratios. If we
replace one or more of these resistors with a capacitor, it is possible to obtain
some interesting circuits in which the output is proportional to either the
derivative or integral of the input voltage. Such circuits find widespread use
in practice. For example, a velocity sensor can be connected to an op amp cir-
cuit that provides a signal proportional to the acceleration, or an output signal
can be obtained that represents the total charge incident on a metal electrode
during a specific period of time by simply integrating the measured current.
To create an integrator using an ideal op amp, we ground the noninvert-
ing input, install an ideal capacitor as a feedback element from the output
back to the inverting input, and connect a signal source v s to the inverting
input through an ideal resistor as shown in Fig. 7.27.
Performing nodal analysis at the inverting input,

We therefore have combined a resistor, a capacitor, and an op amp to form
an integrator. Note that the first term of the output is 1/RC times the negative
of the integral of the input from t = 0 to t, and the second term is the nega-
tive of the initial value of v C f . The value of (RC) −1 can be made equal to
unity, if we wish, by choosing R = 1 M and C = 1 μF, for example; other
selections may be made that will increase or decrease the output voltage.
Before we leave the integrator circuit, we might anticipate a question
from an inquisitive reader, “Could we use an inductor in place of the capaci-
tor and obtain a differentiator?” Indeed we could, but circuit designers usu-
ally avoid the use of inductors whenever possible because of their size,
weight, cost, and associated resistance and capacitance. Instead, it is possi-
ble to interchange the positions of the resistor and capacitor in Fig. 7.27 and
obtain a differentiator.

CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
7.6 DUALITY
•
3 ⍀
The concept of duality applies to many fundamental engineering concepts.
In this section, we shall define duality in terms of the circuit equations. Two
circuits are “duals” if the mesh equations that characterize one of them have
the same mathematical form as the nodal equations that characterize the
other. They are said to be exact duals if each mesh equation of one circuit is
numerically identical with the corresponding nodal equation of the other;
the current and voltage variables themselves cannot be identical, of course.
Duality itself merely refers to any of the properties exhibited by dual
circuits.
Let us use the definition to construct an exact dual circuit by writing the
two mesh equations for the circuit shown in Fig. 7.30. Two mesh currents i 1
and i 2 are assigned, and the mesh equations are

We may now construct the two equations that describe the exact dual

placing the mesh currents i 1 and i 2 in Eqs. [18] and [19] by the two nodal
voltages v 1 and v 2 , respectively. We obtain

and we now seek the circuit represented by these two nodal equations.
Let us first draw a line to represent the reference node, and then we may
establish two nodes at which the positive references for v 1 and v 2 are lo-
cated. Equation [20] indicates that a current source of 2 cos 6t A is con-
nected between node 1 and the reference node, oriented to provide a current
entering node 1. This equation also shows that a 3 S conductance appears
between node 1 and the reference node. Turning to Eq. [21], we first con-
sider the nonmutual terms, i.e., those terms which do not appear in Eq. [20],
and they instruct us to connect an 8 H inductor and a 5 S conductance
(in parallel) between node 2 and the reference. The two similar terms in
Eqs. [20] and [21] represent a 4 F capacitor present mutually at nodes 1 and
2; the circuit is completed by connecting this capacitor between the two
nodes. The constant term on the right side of Eq. [21] is the value of the
inductor current at t = 0; in other words, i L (0) = 10 A. The dual circuit is
shown in Fig. 7.31; since the two sets of equations are numerically identi-
cal, the circuits are exact duals.
Dual circuits may be obtained more readily than by this method, for the
equations need not be written. In order to construct the dual of a given cir-
cuit, we think of the circuit in terms of its mesh equations. With each mesh
we must associate a nonreference node, and, in addition, we must supply the
reference node. On a diagram of the given circuit we therefore place aSECTION 7.6 DUALITY
node in the center of each mesh and supply the reference node as a line near
the diagram or a loop enclosing the diagram. Each element that appears
jointly in two meshes is a mutual element and gives rise to identical terms,
except for sign, in the two corresponding mesh equations. It must be re-
placed by an element that supplies the dual term in the two corresponding
nodal equations. This dual element must therefore be connected directly be-
tween the two nonreference nodes that are within the meshes in which the
given mutual element appears.
The nature of the dual element itself is easily determined; the mathe-
matical form of the equations will be the same only if inductance is replaced
by capacitance, capacitance by inductance, conductance by resistance, and
resistance by conductance. Thus, the 4 H inductor which is common to
meshes 1 and 2 in the circuit of Fig. 7.30 appears as a 4 F capacitor con-
nected directly between nodes 1 and 2 in the dual circuit.
Elements that appear only in one mesh must have duals that appear be-
tween the corresponding node and the reference node. Referring again to
Fig. 7.30, the voltage source 2 cos 6t V appears only in mesh 1; its dual is a
current source 2 cos 6t A, which is connected only to node 1 and the refer-
ence node. Since the voltage source is clockwise-sensed, the current source
must be into-the-nonreference-node-sensed. Finally, provision must be
made for the dual of the initial voltage present across the 8 F capacitor in the
given circuit. The equations have shown us that the dual of this initial volt-
age across the capacitor is an initial current through the inductor in the dual
circuit; the numerical values are the same, and the correct sign of the initial
current may be determined most readily by considering both the initial volt-
age in the given circuit and the initial current in the dual circuit as sources.
Thus, if v C in the given circuit is treated as a source, it would appear as −v C
on the right side of the mesh equation; in the dual circuit, treating the cur-
rent i L as a source would yield a term −i L on the right side of the nodal equa-
tion. Since each has the same sign when treated as a source, then, if
v C (0) = 10 V, i L (0) must be 10 A.
The circuit of Fig. 7.30 is repeated in Fig. 7.32, and its exact dual is con-
structed on the circuit diagram itself by merely drawing the dual of each
given element between the two nodes that are inside the two meshes that are
common to the given element. A reference node that surrounds the given
circuit may be helpful. After the dual circuit is redrawn in more standard
form, it appears as shown in Fig. 7.31.

(b) The dual circuit is drawn in more conventional form for comparison to the original.
An additional example of the construction of a dual circuit is shown in
Fig. 7.33a and b. Since no particular element values are specified, these two
circuits are duals, but not necessarily exact duals. The original circuit may
be recovered from the dual by placing a node in the center of each of the five
meshes of Fig. 7.33b and proceeding as before.
The concept of duality may also be carried over into the language by which
we describe circuit analysis or operation. For example, if we are given a volt-
age source in series with a capacitor, we might wish to make the important
statement, “The voltage source causes a current to flo through the capacitor.”
The dual statement is, “The current source causes a voltage to exist across the
inductor.” The dual of a less carefully worded statement, such as “The current
goes round and round the series circuit,” may require a little inventiveness. 4
Practice in using dual language can be obtained by reading Thévenin’s
theorem in this sense; Norton’s theorem should result.
We have spoken of dual elements, dual language, and dual circuits.
What about a dual network? Consider a resistor R and an inductor L in
series. The dual of this two-terminal network exists and is most readily
obtained by connecting some ideal source to the given network. The dual
circuit is then obtained as the dual source in parallel with a conductance G
with the same magnitude as R, and a capacitance C having the same magni-
tude as L. We consider the dual network as the two-terminal network that is
connected to the dual source; it is thus a pair of terminals between which G
and C are connected in parallel.
Before leaving the definition of duality, we should point out that duality
is defined on the basis of mesh and nodal equations. Since nonplanar
circuits cannot be described by a system of mesh equations, a circuit that
cannot be drawn in planar form does not possess a dual.
We shall use duality principally to reduce the work that we must do to
analyze the simple standard circuits. After we have analyzed the series RL
circuit, the parallel RC circuit requires less attention, not because it is less
important, but because the analysis of the dual network is already known.
Since the analysis of some complicated circuit is not apt to be well known,
duality will usually not provide us with any quick solution.
(4) Someone suggested, “The voltage is across all over the parallel circuit.”245

7.7 MODELING CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
• WITH PSPICE
When using PSpice to analyze circuits containing inductors and capacitors, it
is frequently necessary to be able to specify the initial condition of each
element [i.e., v C (0) and i L (0)]. This is achieved by double-clicking on the
element symbol, resulting in the dialog box shown in Fig. 7.35a. At the far
right (not shown), we find the value of the capacitance, which defaults to 1 nF.
We can also specify the initial condition (IC), set to 2 V in Fig. 7.35a. Click-
ing on the right mouse button and selecting Display results in the dialog box
shown in Fig. 7.35b, which allows the initial condition to be displayed on the
schematic. The procedure for setting the initial condition of an inductor is es-
sentially the same. We should also note that when a capacitor is first placed in
the schematic, it appears horizontally; the positive reference terminal for the
initial voltage is the left terminal.

In order to obtain time-varying voltages and currents, we need to per-
form what is referred to as a transient analysis. Under the PSpice menu,
we create a New Simulation Profil named op amp integrator, which
leads to the dialog box recreated in Fig. 7.38. Run to time represents the

time at which the simulation is terminated; PSpice will select its own
discrete times at which to calculate the various voltages and currents.
Occasionally we obtain an error message stating that the transient solu-
tion could not converge, or the output waveform does not appear as
smooth as we would like. In such situations, it is useful to set a value for
Maximum step size, which has been set to 0.5 ms in this example.
From our earlier analysis and Eq. [17], we expect the output to be
proportional to the negative integral of the input waveform, i.e.,
v out = 0.319 cos 100t − 2.319 V, as shown in Fig. 7.39. The initial
condition of 2 V across the capacitor has combined with a constant
term from the integration to result in a nonzero average value for the
output, unlike the input which has an average value of zero.
■ FIGURE 7.39 Probe output for the simulated integrator circuit along with the input waveform

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
A large number of practical circuits can be effectively modeled using only
resistors and voltage/current sources. However, most interesting everyday
occurrences somehow involve something changing with time, and in such
cases intrinsic capacitances and/or inductances can become important. We
employ such energy storage elements consciously as well, for example, in the
design of frequency-selective filters, capacitor banks, and electric vehicle mo-
tors. An ideal capacitor is modeled as having infinite shunt resistance, and a
current which depends on the time rate of change of the terminal voltage.
Capacitance is measured in units of farads (F). Conversely, an ideal inductor
is modeled as having zero series resistance, and a terminal voltage which de-
pends on the time rate of change of the current. Inductance is measured in
247248
CHAPTER 7 CAPACITORS AND INDUCTORS
units of henrys (H). Either element can store energy; the amount of energy
present in a capacitor (stored in its electric field) is proportional to the square
of the terminal voltage, and the amount of energy present in an inductor
(stored in its magnetic field) is proportional to the square of its current.
As we found for resistors, we can simplify some connections of capaci-
tors (or inductors) using series/parallel combinations. The validity of such
equivalents arises from KCL and KVL. Once we have simplified a circuit as
much as possible (taking care not to “combine away” a component which is
used to define a current or voltage of interest to us), nodal and mesh analy-
sis can be applied to circuits with capacitors and inductors. However, the
resulting integrodifferential equations are often nontrivial to solve, and so
we will consider some practical approaches in the next two chapters. Simple
circuits, however, such as those which involve a single operational ampli-
fier, can be analyzed easily. We found (to our surprise) that such circuits can
be used as signal integrators or differentiators. Consequently, they provide
an output signal that tells us how some input quantity (accumulating charge
during ion implantation into a silicon wafer, for example) varies with time.
As a final note, capacitors and inductors provide a particularly strong
example of the concept known as duality. KCL and KVL, mesh and nodal
analysis are other examples. Circuits are rarely analyzed using this idea, but
it is nevertheless important, since the implication is that we only need to
learn roughly “half” of the complete set of concepts, and then determine
how to translate the remainder. Some people find this helpful; others don’t.
Regardless, capacitors and inductors are straightforward to model in PSpice
and other circuit simulation tools, allowing us to check our answers. The
difference between those elements and resistors in such software packages
is that we must take care to set the initial condition properly.
As an additional review aid, here we list some key points from the
chapter, and identify relevant example(s).
❑ The current through a capacitor is given by i = C dv/dt . (Example 7.1)
❑ The voltage across a capacitor is related to its current by

A capacitor is an open circuit to dc voltages. (Example 7.1)

An inductor is a short circuit to dc currents. (Examples 7.4, 7.5)
The energy presently stored in a capacitor is given by 12 Cv 2 , whereas
the energy presently stored in an inductor is given by 12 Li 2 ; both are
referenced to a time at which no energy was stored. (Examples 7.3, 7.7)
Series and parallel combinations of inductors can be combined using
the same equations as for resistors. (Example 7.8)249

❑
Series and parallel combinations of capacitors work the opposite way
as they do for resistors. (Example 7.8)
Since capacitors and inductors are linear elements, KVL, KCL,
superposition, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems, and nodal and
mesh analysis apply to their circuits as well. (Example 7.9)
A capacitor as the feedback element in an inverting op amp leads to
an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input voltage.
Swapping the input resistor and the feedback capacitor leads to an
output voltage proportional to the derivative of the input voltage.
(Example 7.10)
PSpice allows us to set the initial voltage across a capacitor, and the
initial current through an inductor. A transient analysis provides details
of the time-dependent response of circuits containing these types of
elements. (Example 7.11)

5. Two pieces of gadolinium, each measuring 100 μm × 750 μm and 604 nm
thick, are used to construct a capacitor. The two plates are arranged such that

9. A silicon pn junction diode is characterized by a junction capacitance defined as
C j =
K s ε 0 A
W
where K s = 11.8 for silicon, ε 0 is the vacuum permittivity, A = the cross-
sectional area of the junction, and W is known as the depletion width of the
junction. Width W depends not only on how the diode is fabricated, but also on
the voltage applied to its two terminals. It can be computed using
W =
2K s ε 0
(V bi − V A )
qN
Thus, diodes are frequently used in electronic circuits, since they can be
thought of as voltage-controlled capacitors. Assuming parameter values of
N = 10 18 cm −3 , V bi = 0.57 V, and using q = 1.6 × 10 −19 C, calculate the
capacitance of a diode with cross-sectional area A 1 μm × 1 μm at applied
voltages of V A = −1, −5, and −10 volts.

55. A new piece of equipment designed to make crystals from molten constituents
is experiencing too many failures (cracked products). The production manager
wants to monitor the cooling rate to see if this is related to the problem. The
system has two output terminals available, where the voltage across them is
linearly proportional to the crucible temperature such that 30 mV corresponds
to 30 ◦ C and 1 V corresponds to 1000 ◦ C. Design a circuit whose voltage output
represents the cooling rate, calibrated such that 1 V = 1 ◦ C/s.
56. A confectionary company has decided to increase the production rate of its
milk chocolate bars to compensate for a recent increase in the cost of raw
materials. However, the wrapping unit cannot accept more than 1 bar per sec-
ond, or it drops bars. A 200 mV peak-to-peak sinusoidal voltage signal is avail-
able from the bar-making system which feeds into the wrapping unit, such that
its frequency matches the bar production frequency (i.e., 1 Hz = 1 bar/s).
Design a circuit that provides a voltage output sufficient to power a 12 V audi-
ble alarm when the production rate exceeds the capacity of the wrapping unit.
57. One problem satellites face is exposure to high-energy particles, which can
cause damage to sensitive electronics as well as solar arrays used to provide
power. A new communications satellite is equipped with a high-energy proton
detector measuring 1 cm × 1 cm. It provides a current directly equal to the
number of protons impinging the surface per second. Design a circuit whose
output voltage provides a running total of the number of proton hits, calibrated
such that 1 V = 1 million hits.
58. The output of a velocity sensor attached to a sensitive piece of mobile equip-
ment is calibrated to provide a signal such that 10 mV corresponds to linear
motion at 1 m/s. If the equipment is subjected to sudden shock, it can be dam-
aged. Since force = mass × acceleration, monitoring of the rate of change of
velocity can be used to determine if the equipment is transported improperly.

such that 10 mV = 1 m/s 2 . (b) How many sensor-circuit combinations does
this application require?

called a potentiometer) such that a full tank (100 liters) corresponds to 1 and
an empty tank corresponds to 10 . (a) Design a circuit that provides an output
voltage which indicates the amount of fuel remaining, so that 1 V = empty and
5 V = full. (b) Design a circuit to indicate the rate of fuel consumption by

INTRODUCTION
In Chap. 7 we wrote equations for the response of several circuits
containing both inductance and capacitance, but we did not solve
any of them. Now we are ready to proceed with the solution of the
simpler circuits, namely, those which contain only resistors and
inductors, or only resistors and capacitors.
Although the circuits we are about to consider have a very
elementary appearance, they are also of practical importance.
Networks of this form find use in electronic amplifiers, automatic
control systems, operational amplifiers, communications equip-
ment, and many other applications. Familiarity with these simple
circuits will enable us to predict the accuracy with which the
output of an amplifier can follow an input that is changing rapidly
with time, or to predict how quickly the speed of a motor will
change in response to a change in its field current. Our understand-
ing of simple RL and RC circuits will also enable us to suggest
modifications to the amplifier or motor in order to obtain a more
desirable response.

The analysis of circuits containing inductors and/or capacitors is de-
pendent upon the formulation and solution of the integrodifferential
equations that characterize the circuits. We will call the special type
of equation we obtain a homogeneous linear differential equation,
which is simply a differential equation in which every term is of the
first degree in the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. A
solution is obtained when we have found an expression for the

It may seem pretty strange to discuss a time-varying
current flowing in a circuit with no sources! Keep in
mind that we only know the current at the time speci-
fied as t 0; we don’t know the current prior to that
time. In the same vein, we don’t know what the circuit
looked like prior to t 0, either. In order for a current
to be flowing, a source had to have been present at
some point, but we are not privy to this information.
Fortunately, it is not required in order to analyze the
circuit we are given.
dependent variable that satisfies both the differential equation and also the
prescribed energy distribution in the inductors or capacitors at a prescribed
instant of time, usually t = 0.
The solution of the differential equation represents a response of the
circuit, and it is known by many names. Since this response depends upon
the general “nature’’ of the circuit (the types of elements, their sizes, the
interconnection of the elements), it is often called a natural response.
However, any real circuit we construct cannot store energy forever; the
resistances intrinsically associated with inductors and capacitors will even-
tually convert all stored energy into heat. The response must eventually die
out, and for this reason it is frequently referred to as the transient response.
Finally, we should also be familiar with the mathematicians’ contribution to
the nomenclature; they call the solution of a homogeneous linear differen-
tial equation a complementary function.
When we consider independent sources acting on a circuit, part of the re-
sponse will resemble the nature of the particular source (or forcing function)
used; this part of the response, called the particular solution, the steady-state
response, or the forced response, will be “complemented’’ by the comple-
mentary response produced in the source-free circuit. The complete response
of the circuit will then be given by the sum of the complementary function
and the particular solution. In other words, the complete response is the sum
of the natural response and the forced response. The source-free response may
be called the natural response, the transient response, the free response, or
the complementary function, but because of its more descriptive nature, we
will most often call it the natural response.
We will consider several different methods of solving these differential
equations. The mathematical manipulation, however, is not circuit analysis.
Our greatest interest lies in the solutions themselves, their meaning, and
their interpretation, and we will try to become sufficiently familiar with the
form of the response that we are able to write down answers for new circuits
by just plain thinking. Although complicated analytical methods are needed
when simpler methods fail, a well-developed intuition is an invaluable
resource in such situations.
We begin our study of transient analysis by considering the simple series
RL circuit shown in Fig. 8.1. Let us designate the time-varying current as i(t);
we will represent the value of i(t) at t = 0 as I 0 ; in other words, i(0) = I 0 . We
therefore have
Ri + v L = Ri + L
or
di
= 0
dt
R
di
+ i = 0

[1]
Our goal is an expression for i(t) which satisfies this equation and also
has the value I 0 at t = 0. The solution may be obtained by several different
methods.
A Direct Approach
One very direct method of solving a differential equation consists of writ-
ing the equation in such a way that the variables are separated, and then263
SECTION 8.1 THE SOURCE-FREE RL CIRCUIT
integrating each side of the equation. The variables in Eq. [1] are i and t, and
it is apparent that the equation may be multiplied by dt, divided by i, and
arranged with the variables separated:
di
R
= − dt
i
L
[2]
Since the current is I 0 at t = 0 and i(t) at time t, we may equate the two
definite integrals which are obtained by integrating each side between the
corresponding limits:
i(t)

Performing the indicated integration,

which results in
R
ln i − ln I 0 = − (t − 0)
L
After a little manipulation, we find that the current i(t) is given by
i(t) = I 0 e −Rt/L
[3]
We check our solution by first showing that substitution of Eq. [3] in
Eq. [1] yields the identity 0 = 0, and then showing that substitution of t = 0
in Eq. [3] produces i(0) = I 0 . Both steps are necessary; the solution must
satisfy the differential equation which characterizes the circuit, and it must
also satisfy the initial condition.
EXAMPLE 8.1

expression for i L (t) valid for t > 0, and its value at t
0, find an
200 μs.
50 mH
This is the identical type of circuit just considered, so we expect an
inductor current of the form
200 ⍀
i L = I 0 e −Rt/L
where R = 200 , L = 50 mH and I 0 is the initial current flowing
through the inductor at t = 0. Thus,
i L (t) = 2e
−4000t
Substituting t = 200 × 10 −6 s, we find that i L (t) = 898.7 mA, less
than half the initial value.

CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS
An Alternative Approach
The solution may also be obtained by a slight variation of the method we
just described. After separating the variables, we now also include a con-
stant of integration. Thus,
di
=−
i
R
dt + K
L
and integration gives us
R
ln i = − t + K
L
[4]
The constant K cannot be evaluated by substitution of Eq. [4] in the orig-
inal differential equation [1]; the identity 0 = 0 will result, because Eq. [4]
is a solution of Eq. [1] for any value of K (try it out on your own). The con-
stant of integration must be selected to satisfy the initial condition
i(0) = I 0 . Thus, at t = 0, Eq. [4] becomes
ln I 0 = K
and we use this value for K in Eq. [4] to obtain the desired response
R
ln i = − t + ln I 0
L
or
i(t) = I 0 e −Rt/L
as before.
A More General Solution Approach
Either of these methods can be used when the variables are separable, but
this is not always the situation. In the remaining cases we will rely on a very
powerful method, the success of which will depend upon our intuition or
experience. We simply guess or assume a form for the solution and then test
our assumptions, first by substitution in the differential equation, and then
by applying the given initial conditions. Since we cannot be expected to
guess the exact numerical expression for the solution, we will assume a so-
lution containing several unknown constants and select the values for these
constants in order to satisfy the differential equation and the initial condi-
tions. Many of the differential equations encountered in circuit analysis
have a solution which may be represented by the exponential function or by
the sum of several exponential functions. Let us assume a solution of Eq. [1]
in exponential form,
i(t) = Ae s 1 t
[5]
where A and s 1 are constants to be determined. After substituting this as-
sumed solution in Eq. [1], we have

or
s 1 +

Ae s 1 t = 0
[6]
In order to satisfy this equation for all values of time, it is necessary that
A = 0, or s 1 = −∞, or s 1 = −R/L . But if A = 0 or s 1 = −∞, then every
response is zero; neither can be a solution to our problem. Therefore, we
must choose

[7]
and our assumed solution takes on the form
Determine the value for
one constant that does not
result in a trivial solution.
i(t) = Ae −Rt/L
The remaining constant must be evaluated by applying the initial condi-
tion i(0) = I 0 . Thus, A = I 0 , and the final form of the assumed solution is
(again)
Invoke the initial
condition(s) to determine
values for the remaining
constant(s).
i(t) = I 0 e −Rt/L
A summary of the basic approach is outlined in Fig. 8.4.
A Direct Route: The Characteristic Equation
In fact, there is a more direct route that we can take. In obtaining Eq. [7], we
solved
R
s 1 + = 0
L
[8]
which is known as the characteristic equation. We can obtain the charac-
teristic equation directly from the differential equation, without the need for
substitution of our trial solution. Consider the general first-order differential
equation
a
df
+ bf = 0
dt
where a and b are constants. We substitute s 1 for d f /dt and s 0 for f, result-
ing in
a
df
+ b f = (as + b) f = 0
dt
From this we may directly obtain the characteristic equation
as + b = 0
which has the single root s = −b/a. The solution to our differential equa-
tion is then
f = Ae −bt/a
This basic procedure is easily extended to second-order differential equa-
tions, as we will explore in Chap. 9.

᭤ Determine if additional information is required.
From previous experience, we know that a complete expression for v
will require knowledge of v at a specific instant of time, with t = 0
being the most convenient. We might be tempted to look at Fig. 8.5b
and write v(0) = 24 V, but this is only true just before the switch
opens. The resistor voltage can change to any value in the instant
that the switch is thrown; only the inductor current must remain
unchanged.
In the circuit of Fig. 8.5b, i L = 24/10 = 2.4 A since the inductor
acts like a short circuit to a dc current. Therefore, i L (0) = 2.4 A in the
circuit of Fig. 8.5c, as well—a key point in analyzing this type of cir-
cuit. Therefore, in the circuit of Fig. 8.5c, v(0) = (40)(−2.4) = −96 V.
᭤ Attempt a solution.
Any of the three basic solution techniques can be brought to bear; let’s
start by writing the characteristic equation corresponding to Eq. [9]:
s + 10 = 0267
SECTION 8.1 THE SOURCE-FREE RL CIRCUIT
Solving, we find that s = −10, so
v(t) = Ae −10t
[10]
(which, upon substitution into the left-hand side of Eq. [9], results in
−10Ae −10t + 10Ae −10t = 0
as expected.)
We find A by setting t = 0 in Eq. [10] and employing the fact that
v(0) = −96 V. Thus,
v(t) = −96e −10t
[11]
and so v(0.2) = −12.99 V, down from a maximum of −96 V.
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
Instead of writing a differential equation in v, we could have written
our differential equation in terms of i L :
di L
40i L + 10i L + 5
= 0
dt
or
di L
+ 10i L = 0
dt
which has the solution i L = Be −10t . With i L (0) = 2.4, we find that
i L (t) = 2.4e −10t . Since v = −40i L , we once again obtain Eq. [11]. We
should note: it is no coincidence that the inductor current and the
resistor voltage have the same exponential dependence!

Ans: −25e −2t V .
Accounting for the Energy
Before we turn our attention to the interpretation of the response, let us re-
turn to the circuit of Fig. 8.1, and check the power and energy relationships.
The power being dissipated in the resistor is
p R = i 2 R = I 0 2 Re −2Rt/L
and the total energy turned into heat in the resistor is found by integrating
the instantaneous power from zero time to infinite time:

This is the result we expect, because the total energy stored initially in
the inductor is 12 L I 0 2 , and there is no longer any energy stored in the induc-
tor at infinite time since its current eventually drops to zero. All the initial
energy therefore is accounted for by dissipation in the resistor.

PROPERTIES OF THE EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE
Let us now consider the nature of the response in the series RL circuit. We
have found that the inductor current is represented by
i(t) = I 0 e −Rt/L
At t = 0, the current has value I 0 , but as time increases, the current decreases
and approaches zero. The shape of this decaying exponential is seen by the
plot of i(t)/I 0 versus t shown in Fig. 8.7. Since the function we are plotting is
e −Rt/L , the curve will not change if R/L remains unchanged. Thus, the same
curve must be obtained for every series R L circuit having the same L/R
ratio. Let us see how this ratio affects the shape of the curve.
i
I 0

0
■ FIGURE 8.7 A plot of e −Rt/L versus t.
If we double the ratio of L to R, the exponent will be unchanged only if
t is also doubled. In other words, the original response will occur at a later
time, and the new curve is obtained by moving each point on the original
curve twice as far to the right. With this larger L/R ratio, the current takes
longer to decay to any given fraction of its original value. We might have a
tendency to say that the “width’’ of the curve is doubled, or that the width is
proportional to L/R. However, we find it difficult to define our term width,
because each curve extends from t = 0 to ∞! Instead, let us consider the
time that would be required for the current to drop to zero if it continued to
drop at its initial rate.
The initial rate of decay is found by evaluating the derivative at zero time:

We designate the value of time it takes for i/I 0 to drop from unity to zero, as-
suming a constant rate of decay, by the Greek letter τ (tau). Thus,

or

[12]SECTION 8.2 PROPERTIES OF THE EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE
The ratio L/R has the units of seconds, since the exponent −Rt/L must
be dimensionless. This value of time τ is called the time constant and is
shown pictorially in Fig. 8.8. The time constant of a series RL circuit may
be found graphically from the response curve; it is necessary only to draw
the tangent to the curve at t = 0 and determine the intercept of this tangent
line with the time axis. This is often a convenient way of approximating the
time constant from the display on an oscilloscope.

■ FIGURE 8.8 The time constant τ is L /R for a series RL circuit. It is the time required for the response
curve to drop to zero if it decays at a constant rate equal to its initial rate of decay.
An equally important interpretation of the time constant τ is obtained by
determining the value of i(t)/I 0 at t = τ . We have
i(τ )
= e −1 = 0.3679
I 0
i(τ ) = 0.3679I 0
or
Thus, in one time constant the response has dropped to 36.8 percent of
its initial value; the value of τ may also be determined graphically from this
fact, as indicated by Fig. 8.9. It is convenient to measure the decay of the
current at intervals of one time constant, and recourse to a hand calculator
shows that i(t)/I 0 is 0.3679 at t = τ , 0.1353 at t = 2τ , 0.04979 at t = 3τ ,
0.01832 at t = 4τ , and 0.006738 at t = 5τ . At some point three to five
time constants after zero time, most of us would agree that the current is a

it take for the current to decay to zero?’’ our answer might be, “About

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
The transient analysis capability of PSpice is very useful when consider-
ing the response of source-free circuits. In this example, we make use of
a special feature that allows us to vary a component parameter, similar to
the way we varied the dc voltage in other simulations. We do this by
adding the component PARAM to our schematic; it may be placed any-
where, as we will not wire it into the circuit. Our complete RL circuit is
shown in Fig. 8.10, which includes an initial inductor current of 1 mA.
In order to relate our resistor value to the proposed parameter
sweep, we must perform three tasks. First, we provide a name for our
parameter, which we choose to call Resistance for the sake of simplic-
ity. This is accomplished by double-clicking on the PARAMETERS:
label in the schematic, which opens the Property Editor for this pseudo-
component. Clicking on New Column results in the dialog box shown
in Fig. 8.11a, in which we enter Resistance under Name and a place-
holder value of 1 under Value. Our second task consists of linking the

SECTION 8.2 PROPERTIES OF THE EXPONENTIAL RESPONSE
value of R1 to our parameter sweep, which we accomplish by double-
clicking on the default value of R1 on the schematic, resulting in the
dialog box of Fig. 8.11b. Under Value, we simply enter {Resistance}.
(Note the curly brackets are required.)

(b)
■ FIGURE 8.11 (a) Add New Column dialog box in the Property Editor for PARAM. (b) Resistor
value dialog box.
Our third task consists of setting up the simulation, which includes
setting transient analysis parameters as well as the values we desire for
R1. Under PSpice we select New Simulation Profil (Fig. 8.12a), in
which we select Time Domain (Transient) for Analysis type, 300 ns
for Run to time, and tick the Parametric Sweep box under Options.
This last action results in the dialog box shown in Fig. 8.12b, in which
we select Global parameter for Sweep variable and enter Resistance
for Parameter name. The final setup step required is to select
Logarithmic under Sweep type, a Start value of 10, an End value
of 1000, and 1 Points/Decade; alternatively we could list the desired
resistor values using Value list.
After running the simulation, the notification box shown in Fig. 8.13
appears, listing the available data sets for plotting (Resistance = 10,
100, and 1000 in this case). A particular data set is selected by high-
lighting it; we select all three for this example. Upon selecting the

inductor current from our Trace variable choices in Probe, we obtain
three graphs at once, as shown (after labeling by hand) in Fig. 8.14.
■ FIGURE 8.14 Probe output for the three resistances.
Why does a larger value of the time constant L/R produce a
response curve that decays more slowly? Let us consider the effect of
each element.
In terms of the time constant τ, the response of the series R L circuit
may be written simply as
i(t) = I 0 e −t/τ
An increase in L allows a greater energy storage for the same initial
current, and this larger energy requires a longer time to be dissipated in
the resistor. We may also increase L/R by reducing R. In this case, the
power flowing into the resistor is less for the same initial current; again,
a greater time is required to dissipate the stored energy. This effect is
seen clearly in our simulation result of Fig. 8.14.

THE SOURCE-FREE RC CIRCUIT
Circuits based on resistor-capacitor combinations are more common than
their resistor-inductor analogs. The principal reasons for this are the smaller
losses present in a physical capacitor, lower cost, better agreement between
the simple mathematical model and the actual device behavior, and also
smaller size and lighter weight, both of which are particularly important for
integrated-circuit applications.273
SECTION 8.3 THE SOURCE-FREE RC CIRCUIT
Let us see how closely the analysis of the parallel (or is it series?) RC
circuit shown in Fig. 8.15 corresponds to that of the RL circuit. We will as-
sume an initial stored energy in the capacitor by selecting

v(0) = V 0

be zero, so we may write

Equation [13] has a familiar form; comparison with Eq. [1]
di

L
[1]
shows that the replacement of i by v and L/R by RC produces the identical
equation we considered previously. It should, for the RC circuit we are now
analyzing is the dual of the RL circuit we considered first. This duality
forces v(t) for the RC circuit and i(t) for the R L circuit to have identical
expressions if the resistance of one circuit is equal to the reciprocal of the
resistance of the other circuit, and if L is numerically equal to C. Thus, the
response of the R L circuit
i(t) = i(0)e −Rt/L = I 0 e −Rt/L
enables us to immediately write
v(t) = v(0)e −t/RC = V 0 e −t/RC
[14]
for the RC circuit.
Suppose instead that we had selected the current i as our variable in the
RC circuit, rather than the voltage v. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law,

and replacing i with v/R, we obtain Eq. [13] again:

Equation [15] could have been used as our starting point, but the application
of duality principles would not have been as natural.
Let us discuss the physical nature of the voltage response of the RC circuit
as expressed by Eq. [14]. At t = 0 we obtain the correct initial condition, and
as t becomes infinite, the voltage approaches zero. This latter result agrees
with our thinking that if there were any voltage remaining across the capaci-
tor, then energy would continue to flow into the resistor and be dissipated as
heat. Thus, a fina voltage of zero is necessary. The time constant of the RC

the time constant of the RL circuit, or it may be found by simply noting the
time at which the response has dropped to 37 percent of its initial value:
τ
= 1
RC
so that
τ = RC
[16]
Our familiarity with the negative exponential and the significance of the
time constant τ enables us to sketch the response curve readily (Fig. 8.16).
Larger values of R or C provide larger time constants and slower dissipation
of the stored energy. A larger resistance will dissipate a smaller power with
a given voltage across it, thus requiring a greater time to convert the stored
energy into heat; a larger capacitance stores a larger energy with a given
voltage across it, again requiring a greater time to lose this initial energy.

EXAMPLE 8.3
For the circuit of Fig. 8.17a, find the voltage labeled v at t
200 μs.
To find the requested voltage, we will need to draw and analyze two
separate circuits: one corresponding to before the switch is thrown
(Fig. 8.17b), and one corresponding to after the switch is thrown
(Fig. 8.17c).
The sole purpose of analyzing the circuit of Fig. 8.17b is to obtain
an initial capacitor voltage; we assume any transients in that circuit
died out long ago, leaving a purely dc circuit. With no current through
either the capacitor or the 4 resistor, then,
v(0) = 9 V
[17]
We next turn our attention to the circuit of Fig. 8.17c, recognizing that
τ = RC = (2 + 4)(10 × 10 −6 ) = 60 × 10 −6 s
Thus, from Eq. [14],

v(t) = v(0)e −t/RC = v(0)e −t/60×10

A MORE GENERAL PERSPECTIVE
As seen indirectly from Examples 8.2 and 8.3, regardless of how many re-
sistors we have in the circuit, we obtain a single time constant (either
τ = L/R or τ = RC) when only one energy storage element is present. We
can formalize this by realizing that the value needed for R is in fact the
Thévenin equivalent resistance seen by our energy storage element.
(Strange as it may seem, it is even possible to compute a time constant for a
circuit containing dependent sources!)

As an example, consider the circuit shown in Fig. 8.19. The equivalent re-

series and/or parallel combination, then Eq. [19] can be further generalized to

Slicing Thinly: The Distinction Between 0 + and 0 −
Let’s return to the circuit of Fig. 8.19, and assume that some finite amount
of energy is stored in the inductor at t = 0, so that i L (0) = 0.
The inductor current i L is
i L = i L (0)e −t/τ
Note that i L (0 + ) is always equal to i L (0 − ). This is not
necessarily true for the inductor voltage or any resistor
voltage or current, since they may change in zero time.
and this represents what we might call the basic solution to the problem. It
is quite possible that some current or voltage other than i L is needed, such as
the current i 2 in R 2 . We can always apply Kirchhoff’s laws and Ohm’s law
to the resistive portion of the circuit without any difficulty, but current divi-
sion provides the quickest answer in this circuit:
R 1
i 2 = −
[i L (0)e −t/τ ]
R 1 + R 2
It may also happen that we know the initial value of some current other
than the inductor current. Since the current in a resistor may change in-
stantaneously, we will indicate the instant after any change that might have
occurred at t = 0 by the use of the symbol 0 + ; in more mathematical lan-
guage, i 1 (0 + ) is the limit from the right of i 1 (t) as t approaches zero. 1 Thus,
if we are given the initial value of i 1 as i 1 (0 + ), then the initial value of i 2 is
R 1
i 2 (0 + ) = i 1 (0 + )
R 2
From these values, we obtain the necessary initial value of i L :
R 1 + R 2
i L (0 + ) = −[i 1 (0 + ) + i 2 (0 + )] = −
i 1 (0 + )
R 2
and the expression for i 2 becomes
R 1
i 2 = i 1 (0 + ) e −t/τ
R 2
Let us see if we can obtain this last expression more directly. Since the in-
ductor current decays exponentially as e −t/τ , every current throughout the
circuit must follow the same functional behavior. This is made clear by con-
sidering the inductor current as a source current that is being applied to a re-
sistive network. Every current and voltage in the resistive network must have
the same time dependence. Using these ideas, we therefore express i 2 as
i 2 = Ae −t/τ
where
τ =
L
R eq
(1) Note that this is a notational convenience only. When faced with t 0 + or its companion t 0 − in an
equation, we simply use the value zero. This notation allows us to clearly differentiate between the time be-
fore and after an event, such as a switch opening or closing, or a power supply being turned on or off.277
SECTION 8.4 A MORE GENERAL PERSPECTIVE
and A must be determined from a knowledge of the initial value of i 2 . Since
i 1 (0 + ) is known, the voltage across R 1 and R 2 is known, and
R 2 i 2 (0 + ) = R 1 i 1 (0 + )
leads to
i 2 (0 + ) = i 1 (0 + )

R 2
Therefore,
i 2 (t) = i 1 (0 + )

A similar sequence of steps will provide a rapid solution to a large num-
ber of problems. We first recognize the time dependence of the response as
an exponential decay, determine the appropriate time constant by combin-
ing resistances, write the solution with an unknown amplitude, and then de-
termine the amplitude from a given initial condition.
This same technique can be applied to any circuit with one inductor and
any number of resistors, as well as to those special circuits containing two
or more inductors and also two or more resistors that may be simplified by
resistance or inductance combination to one inductor and one resistor.

Thus, the form of the natural response is Ke −50,000t , where K is an
unknown constant. Considering the circuit just prior to the switch open-
ing (t = 0 − ), i L = 18/50 A. Since i L (0 + ) = i L (0 − ), we know that
i L = 18/50 A or 360 mA at t = 0 + and so
i L =
360 mA
t < 0
360e −50,000t mA t ≥ 0
There is no restriction on i 1 changing instantaneously at t = 0, so its
value at t = 0 − (18/90 A or 200 mA) is not relevant to finding i 1 for
t > 0. Instead, we must find i 1 (0 + ) through our knowledge of i L (0 + ).
Using current division,
i 1 (0 + ) = −i L (0 + )

We can verify our analysis using PSpice and the switch model Sw_tOpen,
although it should be remembered that this part is actually just two resis-
tance values: one corresponding to before the switch opens at the specified
time (the default value is 10 m ), and one for after the switch opens (the
default value is 1 M ). If the equivalent resistance of the remainder of the
circuit is comparable to either value, the values should be edited by double-
clicking on the switch symbol in the circuit schematic. Note that there is
also a switch model that closes at a specified time: Sw_tClose.

We have now considered the task of finding the natural response of any
circuit which can be represented by an equivalent inductor in series with an
equivalent resistor. A circuit containing several resistors and several induc-
tors does not always possess a form which allows either the resistors or the
inductors to be combined into single equivalent elements. In such instances,
there is no single negative exponential term or single time constant associ-
ated with the circuit. Rather, there will, in general, be several negativeSECTION 8.4 A MORE GENERAL PERSPECTIVE

exponential terms, the number of terms being equal to the number of induc-
tors that remain after all possible inductor combinations have been made.
General RC Circuits
Many of the RC circuits for which we would like to find the natural response
contain more than a single resistor and capacitor. Just as we did for the RL cir-
cuits, we first consider those cases in which the given circuit may be reduced
to an equivalent circuit consisting of only one resistor and one capacitor.
Let us suppose first that we are faced with a circuit containing a single
capacitor, but any number of resistors. It is possible to replace the two-
terminal resistive network which is across the capacitor terminals with an
equivalent resistor, and we may then write down the expression for the ca-
pacitor voltage immediately. In such instances, the circuit has an effective
time constant given by
τ = R eq C
where R eq is the equivalent resistance of the network. An alternative per-
spective is that R eq is in fact the Thévenin equivalent resistance “seen” by
the capacitor.
If the circuit has more than one capacitor, but they may be replaced
somehow using series and/or parallel combinations with an equivalent
capacitance C eq , then the circuit has an effective time constant given by
τ = RC eq
with the general case expressed as
τ = R eq C eq
It is worth noting, however, that parallel capacitors replaced by an equiva-
lent capacitance would have to have identical initial conditions.

Our method can be applied to circuits with one energy storage element
and one or more dependent sources as well. In such instances, we may write
an appropriate KCL or KVL equation along with any necessary supporting
equations, distill this down into a single differential equation, and extract
the characteristic equation to find the time constant. Alternatively, we may
begin by finding the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the network con-
nected to the capacitor or inductor, and use this in calculating the appropri-
ate RL or RC time constant—unless the dependent source is controlled by a
voltage or current associated with the energy storage element, in which case
the Thévenin approach cannot be used.SECTION 8.4 A MORE GENERAL PERSPECTIVE

Some circuits containing a number of both resistors and capacitors may
be replaced by an equivalent circuit containing only one resistor and one ca-
pacitor; it is necessary that the original circuit be one which can be broken
into two parts, one containing all resistors and the other containing all ca-
pacitors, such that the two parts are connected by only two ideal conductors.
Otherwise, multiple time constants and multiple exponential terms will be
required to describe the behavior of the circuit (one time constant for each
energy storage element remaining in the circuit after it is reduced as much
as possible).
As a parting comment, we should be wary of certain situations involving
only ideal elements which are suddenly connected together. For example,
we may imagine connecting two ideal capacitors in series having unequal
voltages prior to t = 0. This poses a problem using our mathematical model
of an ideal capacitor; however, real capacitors have resistances associated
with them through which energy can be dissipated.

switches; we were informed that certain switching operations were per-
formed at t = 0 in order to remove all the sources from the circuit, while
leaving known amounts of energy stored here and there. In other words, we
have been solving problems in which energy sources are suddenly removed
from the circuit; now we must consider that type of response which results
when energy sources are suddenly applied to a circuit.
We will focus on the response which occurs when the energy sources
suddenly applied are dc sources. Since every electrical device is intended to
be energized at least once, and since most devices are turned on and off
many times in the course of their lifetimes, our study applies to many prac-
tical cases. Even though we are now restricting ourselves to dc sources,
there are still many cases in which these simpler examples correspond to the
operation of physical devices. For example, the first circuit we will analyze
could represent the buildup of the current when a dc motor is started. The
generation and use of the rectangular voltage pulses needed to represent a
number or a command in a microprocessor provide many examples in the
field of electronic or transistor circuitry. Similar circuits are found in the
synchronization and sweep circuits of television receivers, in communica-
tion systems using pulse modulation, and in radar systems, to name but a
few examples.
We have been speaking of the “sudden application’’ of an energy source,
and by this phrase we imply its application in zero time. 2 The operation of a
switch in series with a battery is thus equivalent to a forcing function which
is zero up to the instant that the switch is closed and is equal to the battery
voltage thereafter. The forcing function has a break, or discontinuity, at the
instant the switch is closed. Certain special forcing functions which are
discontinuous or have discontinuous derivatives are called singularity
functions, the two most important of these singularity functions being the
unit-step function and the unit-impulse function.
We define the unit-step forcing function as a function of time which is
zero for all values of its argument less than zero and which is unity for all
positive values of its argument. If we let (t − t 0 ) be the argument and rep-
resent the unit-step function by u, then u(t − t 0 ) must be zero for all values
of t less than t 0 , and it must be unity for all values of t greater than t 0 . At
t = t 0 , u(t − t 0 ) changes abruptly from 0 to 1. Its value at t = t 0 is not de-
fined, but its value is known for all instants of time that are arbitrarily close
to t = t 0 . We often indicate this by writing u(t 0 − ) = 0 and u(t 0 + ) = 1. The
concise mathematical definition of the unit-step forcing function is
u(t − t 0 ) =
0 t < t 0
1 t > t 0
and the function is shown graphically in Fig. 8.26. Note that a vertical line
of unit length is shown at t = t 0 . Although this “riser’’ is not strictly a part
of the definition of the unit step, it is usually shown in each drawing.
(2) Of course, this is not physically possible. However, if the time scale over which such an event occurs is
very short compared to all other relevant time scales that describe the operation of a circuit, this is approxi-
mately true, and mathematically convenient.

CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS
We also note that the unit step need not be a time function. For example,
u(x − x 0 ) could be used to denote a unit-step function where x might be a
distance in meters, for example, or a frequency.
Very often in circuit analysis a discontinuity or a switching action takes
place at an instant that is defined as t = 0. In that case t 0 = 0, and we then
represent the corresponding unit-step forcing function by u(t − 0), or more
simply u(t). This is shown in Fig. 8.27. Thus

The unit-step forcing function is in itself dimensionless. If we wish it to
represent a voltage, it is necessary to multiply u(t − t 0 ) by some constant
voltage, such as 5 V. Thus, v(t) = 5u(t − 0.2) V is an ideal voltage source
which is zero before t = 0.2 s and a constant 5 V after t = 0.2 s. This forc-
ing function is shown connected to a general network in Fig. 8.28a.
Physical Sources and the Unit-Step Function
Perhaps we should ask what physical source is the equivalent of this
discontinuous forcing function. By equivalent, we mean simply that the
voltage-current characteristics of the two networks are identical. For the step-
voltage source of Fig. 8.28a, the voltage-current characteristic is simple:
the voltage is zero prior to t = 0.2 s, it is 5 V after t = 0.2 s, and the current
may be any (finite) value in either time interval. Our first thoughts might
produce the attempt at an equivalent shown in Fig. 8.28b, a 5 V dc source in
series with a switch which closes at t = 0.2 s. This network is not equiva-
lent for t < 0.2 s, however, because the voltage across the battery and
switch is completely unspecified in this time interval. The “equivalent’’
source is an open circuit, and the voltage across it may be anything. After
t = 0.2 s, the networks are equivalent, and if this is the only time interval in
which we are interested, and if the initial currents which flow from the two
networks are identical at t = 0.2 s, then Fig. 8.28b becomes a useful equiv-
alent of Fig. 8.28a.
In order to obtain an exact equivalent for the voltage-step forcing func-
tion, we may provide a single-pole double-throw switch. Before t = 0.2 s,
the switch serves to ensure zero voltage across the input terminals of the
general network. After t = 0.2 s, the switch is thrown to provide a constant
input voltage of 5 V. At t = 0.2 s, the voltage is indeterminate (as is the step
forcing function), and the battery is momentarily short-circuited (it is

fortunate that we are dealing with mathematical models!). This exact equiv-
alent of Fig. 8.28a is shown in Fig. 8.28c.
Figure 8.29a shows a current-step forcing function driving a general
network. If we attempt to replace this circuit by a dc source in parallel with a
switch (which opens at t = t 0 ), we must realize that the circuits are equiva-
lent after t = t 0 but that the responses after t = t 0 are alike only if the initial
conditions are the same. The circuit in Fig. 8.29b implies no voltage exists
across the current source terminals for t < t 0 . This is not the case for the cir-
cuit of Fig. 8.29a. However, we may often use the circuits of Fig. 8.29a and
b interchangeably. The exact equivalent of Fig. 8.29a is the dual of the cir-
cuit of Fig. 8.28c; the exact equivalent of Fig. 8.29b cannot be constructed
with current- and voltage-step forcing functions alone. 3

The Rectangular Pulse Function

The pulse is drawn in Fig. 8.30. Can this pulse be represented in terms of
the unit-step forcing function? Let us consider the difference of the two unit
steps, u(t − t 0 ) − u(t − t 1 ). The two step functions are shown in Fig. 8.31a, and
their difference is a rectangular pulse. The source V 0 u(t − t 0 ) − V 0 u(t − t 1 )
which provides us with the desired voltage is indicated in Fig. 8.31b.

If we have a sinusoidal voltage source V m sin ωt which is suddenly con-

ergy from the transmitter for a radio-controlled car operating at 47 MHz
(295 Mrad/s), we may turn the sinusoidal source off 70 ns later by a second
unit-step forcing function. 4 The voltage pulse is thus
v(t) = V m [u(t − t 0 ) − u(t − t 0 − 7 × 10 −8 )] sin(295 × 10 6 t)

DRIVEN RL CIRCUITS
We are now ready to subject a simple network to the sudden application of
a dc source. The circuit consists of a battery whose voltage is V 0 in series
with a switch, a resistor R, and an inductor L. The switch is closed at t = 0,
as indicated on the circuit diagram of Fig. 8.33a. It is evident that the cur-
rent i(t) is zero before t = 0, and we are therefore able to replace the battery
and switch by a voltage-step forcing function V 0 u(t), which also produces
no response prior to t = 0. After t = 0, the two circuits are clearly identical.
Hence, we seek the current i(t) either in the given circuit of Fig. 8.33a or in
the equivalent circuit of Fig. 8.33b.
We will find i(t) at this time by writing the appropriate circuit equation
and then solving it by separation of the variables and integration. After we
obtain the answer and investigate the two parts of which it is composed, we
will see that there is physical significance to each of these two terms. With
a more intuitive understanding of how each term originates, we will be able
to produce more rapid and more meaningful solutions to every problem in-
volving the sudden application of any source.
Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the circuit of Fig. 8.33b, we have
Ri + L
di
= V 0 u(t)
dt
Since the unit-step forcing function is discontinuous at t = 0, we will
first consider the solution for t < 0 and then for t > 0. The application of
zero voltage since t = −∞ forces a zero response, so that
i(t) = 0
t < 0
For positive time, however, u(t) is unity and we must solve the equation
Ri + L
di

The variables may be separated in several simple algebraic steps, yielding
L di

V 0 − Ri
and each side may be integrated directly:
L
ln(V 0 − Ri) = t + k
R
−
In order to evaluate k, an initial condition must be invoked. Prior to
t = 0, i(t) is zero, and thus i(0 − ) = 0. Since the current in an inductor
cannot change by a finite amount in zero time without being associated with
an infinite voltage, we thus have i(0 + ) = 0. Setting i = 0 at t = 0, we obtain

A More Direct Procedure
This is the desired solution, but it has not been obtained in the simplest man-
ner. In order to establish a more direct procedure, let us try to interpret the two
terms appearing in Eq. [25]. The exponential term has the functional form of
the natural response of the RL circuit; it is a negative exponential, it ap-
proaches zero as time increases, and it is characterized by the time constant
L͞R. The functional form of this part of the response is thus identical with
that which is obtained in the source-free circuit. However, the amplitude
of this exponential term depends on the source voltage V 0 . We might gener-
alize, then, that the response will be the sum of two terms, where one term has
a functional form identical to that of the source-free response, but has an am-
plitude that depends on the forcing function. But what of the other term?
Equation [25] also contains a constant term, V 0 /R. Why is it present?
The answer is simple: the natural response approaches zero as the energy is
gradually dissipated, but the total response must not approach zero. Eventu-
ally the circuit behaves as a resistor and an inductor in series with a battery.
Since the inductor looks like a short circuit to dc, the only current now
287288
CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS
flowing is V 0 /R. This current is a part of the response that is directly attrib-
utable to the forcing function, and we call it the forced response. It is the
response that is present a long time after the switch is closed.
The complete response is composed of two parts, the natural response
and the forced response. The natural response is a characteristic of the cir-
cuit and not of the sources. Its form may be found by considering the
source-free circuit, and it has an amplitude that depends on both the initial
amplitude of the source and the initial energy storage. The forced response
has the characteristics of the forcing function; it is found by pretending that
all switches were thrown a long time ago. Since we are presently concerned
only with switches and dc sources, the forced response is merely the solu-
tion of a simple dc circuit problem.

What is meant by i(3 − )? This is simply a notational convenience to
indicate the instant before the voltage source changes value. For t < 3,
u(t − 3) = 0. Thus, i(3 − ) = 0 as well.
At t = 3 + , the forcing function 12u(t − 3) = 12 V. However, since
the inductor current cannot change in zero time, i(3 + ) = i(3 − ) = 0.
The most straightforward approach to analyzing the circuit for
t > 3 s is to rewrite Eq. [25] as
i(t ) =
V 0
V 0
− e −Rt /L u(t )

and note that this equation applies to our circuit as well if we shift the
time axis such that
t = t − 3
Therefore, with V 0 /R = 12 mA and R/L = 20,000 s −1 ,
i(t − 3) = 12 − 12e −20,000(t−3) u(t − 3)

[26]
which can be written more simply as
i(t) = 12 − 12e −20,000(t−3) u(t − 3)

Substituting t = 3.0001 s into Eq. [26] or [27], we find that

Developing an Intuitive Understanding
The reason for the two responses, forced and natural, may be seen from
physical arguments. We know that our circuit will eventually assume the
forced response. However, at the instant the switches are thrown, the initial
inductor currents (or, in RC circuits, the voltages across the capacitors) will
have values that depend only on the energy stored in these elements. These
currents or voltages cannot be expected to be the same as the currents and
voltages demanded by the forced response. Hence, there must be a transient
period during which the currents and voltages change from their given ini-
tial values to their required final values. The portion of the response that
provides the transition from initial to final values is the natural response
(often called the transient response, as we found earlier). If we describe the
response of the simple source-free RL circuit in these terms, then we should
say that the forced response is zero and that the natural response serves to
connect the initial response dictated by the stored energy with the zero value
of the forced response.
This description is appropriate only for those circuits in which the nat-
ural response eventually dies out. This always occurs in physical circuits
where some resistance is associated with every element, but there are a
number of “pathologic’’ circuits in which the natural response is nonvan-
ishing as time becomes infinite. Those circuits in which trapped currents
circulate around inductive loops, or voltages are trapped in series strings of
capacitors, are examples.
8.7
•
NATURAL AND FORCED RESPONSE
There is also an excellent mathematical reason for considering the complete
response to be composed of two parts—the forced response and the natural
response. The reason is based on the fact that the solution of any linear
differential equation may be expressed as the sum of two parts: the comple-
mentary solution (natural response) and the particular solution (forced
response). Without delving into the general theory of differential equations,
let us consider a general equation of the type met in the previous section:
di
+ Pi = Q
dt
or
di + Pi dt = Q dt
[28]
We may identify Q as a forcing function and express it as Q(t) to em-
phasize its general time dependence. Let us simplify the discussion by
289290
CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS
assuming that P is a positive constant. Later, we will also assume that Q is
constant, thus restricting ourselves to dc forcing functions.
In any standard text on elementary differential equations, it is shown
that if both sides of Eq. [28] are multiplied by a suitable “integrating factor,”
then each side becomes an exact differential that can be integrated directly
to obtain the solution. We are not separating the variables, but merely ar-
ranging them in such a way that integration is possible. For this equation,
the integrating factor is e P dt or simply e Pt , since P is a constant. We mul-
tiply each side of the equation by this integrating factor and obtain
e Pt di + iPe Pt dt = Qe Pt dt
[29]
The form of the left side may be simplified by recognizing it as the exact
differential of ie Pt :
d(ie Pt ) = e Pt di + iPe Pt dt
so that Eq. [29] becomes
d(ie Pt ) = Qe Pt dt
Integrating each side,
ie Pt =
Qe Pt dt + A
where A is a constant of integration. Multiplication by e −Pt produces the so-
lution for i(t),
i = e −Pt
Qe Pt dt + Ae −Pt
[30]
If our forcing function Q(t) is known, then we can obtain the functional
form of i(t) by evaluating the integral. We will not evaluate such an integral
for each problem, however; instead, we are interested in using Eq. [30] to
draw several very general conclusions.
The Natural Response
We note first that, for a source-free circuit, Q must be zero, and the solution
is the natural response
i n = Ae −Pt
[31]
We will find that the constant P is never negative for a circuit with only
resistors, inductors, and capacitors; its value depends only on the passive
circuit elements 5 and their interconnection in the circuit. The natural re-
sponse therefore approaches zero as time increases without limit. This must
be the case for the simple RL circuit, because the initial energy is gradually
dissipated in the resistor, leaving the circuit in the form of heat. There are
also idealized circuits in which P is zero; in these circuits the natural re-
sponse does not die out.
We therefore find that one of the two terms making up the complete re-
sponse has the form of the natural response; it has an amplitude which will
(5) If the circuit contains a dependent source or a negative resistance, P may be negative.291
SECTION 8.7 NATURAL AND FORCED RESPONSE
depend on (but not always be equal to) the initial value of the complete
response and thus on the initial value of the forcing function also.
The Forced Response
We next observe that the first term of Eq. [30] depends on the functional
form of Q(t), the forcing function. Whenever we have a circuit in which the
natural response dies out as t becomes infinite, this first term must com-
pletely describe the form of the response after the natural response has dis-
appeared. This term is typically called the forced response; it is also called
the steady-state response, the particular solution, or the particular integral.
For the present, we have elected to consider only those problems in-
volving the sudden application of dc sources, and Q(t) will therefore be a
constant for all values of time. If we wish, we can now evaluate the integral
in Eq. [30], obtaining the forced response
Q
i f =
[32]
P
and the complete response
i(t) =
Q
+ Ae −Pt
P
[33]
For the RL series circuit, Q/P is the constant current V 0 /R and 1/P is
the time constant τ . We should see that the forced response might have been
obtained without evaluating the integral, because it must be the complete
response at infinite time; it is merely the source voltage divided by the series
resistance. The forced response is thus obtained by inspection of the final
circuit.
Determination of the Complete Response
Let us use the simple RL series circuit to illustrate how to determine the
complete response by the addition of the natural and forced responses. The
circuit shown in Fig. 8.35 was analyzed earlier, but by a longer method.
The desired response is the current i(t), and we first express this current as
the sum of the natural and the forced current,
i = i n + i f
The functional form of the natural response must be the same as that ob-
tained without any sources. We therefore replace the step-voltage source by
a short circuit and recognize the old RL series loop. Thus,
i n = Ae −Rt/L
where the amplitude A is yet to be determined; since the initial condition
applies to the complete response, we cannot simply assume A = i(0).
We next consider the forced response. In this particular problem the
forced response must be constant, because the source is a constant V 0 for all
positive values of time. After the natural response has died out, there can be
no voltage across the inductor; hence, a voltage V 0 appears across R, and the
forced response is simply

known amplitude. We next combine the two responses to obtain
i = Ae −Rt/L +

and apply the initial condition to evaluate A. The current is zero prior to
t = 0, and it cannot change value instantaneously since it is the current

Note carefully that A is not the initial value of i, since A = −V 0 /R,
while i(0) = 0. In considering source-free circuits, we found that A was the
initial value of the response. When forcing functions are present, however,
we must first find the initial value of the response and then substitute this in
the equation for the complete response to find A.
This response is plotted in Fig. 8.36, and we can see the manner in which
the current builds up from its initial value of zero to its final value of V 0 /R.
The transition is effectively accomplished in a time 3τ. If our circuit repre-
sents the field coil of a large dc motor, we might have L = 10 H and
R = 20 , obtaining τ = 0.5 s. The field current is thus established in about
1.5 s. In one time constant, the current has attained 63.2 percent of its final
value.

We represent the forcing function as the sum of two step-voltage

Although Eqs. [35] through [37] completely describe the response of
the circuit in Fig. 8.39b to the pulse waveform of Fig. 8.39a, the current
waveform itself is sensitive to both the circuit time constant τ and the volt-
age pulse duration t 0 . Two possible curves are shown in Fig. 8.40.295
SECTION 8.8 DRIVEN RC CIRCUITS
The left curve is drawn for the case where the time constant is only one-
half as large as the length of the applied pulse; the rising portion of the
exponential has therefore almost reached V 0 /R before the decaying expo-
nential begins. The opposite situation is shown to the right; there, the time
constant is twice t 0 and the response never has a chance to reach the larger
amplitudes.
The procedure we have been using to find the response of an RL circuit
after dc sources have been switched on or off (or in or out of the circuit) at
some instant of time is summarized in the following. We assume that the
circuit is reducible to a single equivalent resistance R eq in series with a sin-
gle equivalent inductance L eq when all independent sources are set equal to
zero. The response we seek is represented by f (t).
1. With all independent sources zeroed out, simplify the circuit to
determine R eq , L eq , and the time constant τ = L eq /R eq .
2. Viewing L eq as a short circuit, use dc analysis methods to find
i L (0 − ), the inductor current just prior to the discontinuity.
3. Again viewing L eq as a short circuit, use dc analysis methods to
find the forced response. This is the value approached by f (t) as
t → ∞; we represent it by f (∞).
4. Write the total response as the sum of the forced and natural
responses: f (t) = f (∞) + Ae −t/τ .
5. Find f (0 + ) by using the condition that i L (0 + ) = i L (0 − ). If
desired, L eq may be replaced by a current source i L (0 + ) [an open
circuit if i L (0 + ) = 0] for this calculation. With the exception of
inductor currents (and capacitor voltages), other currents and volt-
ages in the circuit may change abruptly.
6. f (0 + ) = f (∞) + A and f (t) = f (∞) + [ f (0 + ) − f (∞)] e −t/τ ,
or total response = final value + (initial value − final value) e −t/τ .

The complete response of any RC circuit may also be obtained as the sum
of the natural and the forced response. Since the procedure is virtually
identical to what we have already discussed in detail for RL circuits, the best
approach at this stage is to illustrate it by working a relevant example com-
pletely, where the goal is not just a capacitor-related quantity but the current
associated with a resistor as well.

by adding a forced response and a natural response. (b) Circuit for t ≤ 0. (c) Circuit for t ≥ 0.
We begin by considering the state of the circuit at t < 0, corresponding
to the switch at position a as represented in Fig. 8.42b. As usual, we
assume no transients are present, so that only a forced response due to
the 120 V source is relevant to finding v C (0 − ). Simple voltage division
then gives us the initial voltage,
50
v C (0) =
(120) = 100 V
50 + 10
Since the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously, this voltage
is equally valid at t = 0 − and t = 0 + .
The switch is now thrown to b, and the complete response is
v C = v C f + v Cn297
SECTION 8.8 DRIVEN RC CIRCUITS
The corresponding circuit has been redrawn in Fig. 8.42c for conve-
nience. The form of the natural response is obtained by replacing the
50 V source by a short circuit and evaluating the equivalent resistance
to find the time constant (in other words, we are finding the Thévenin
equivalent resistance “seen’’ by the capacitor):
R eq =

Thus,
v Cn = Ae −t/R eq C = Ae −t/1.2
In order to evaluate the forced response with the switch at b, we wait
until all the voltages and currents have stopped changing, thus treating
the capacitor as an open circuit, and use voltage division once more:
v C f = 50

200 50

This response is sketched in Fig. 8.43a; again the natural response is
seen to form a transition from the initial to the final response.
Next we attack i(t). This response need not remain constant during
the instant of switching. With the contact at a, it is evident that
i = 50/260 = 192.3 milliamperes. When the switch moves to position
b, the forced response for this current becomes

CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS
To evaluate A, we need to know i(0 + ). This is found by fixing our
attention on the energy-storage element (the capacitor). The fact that
v C must remain 100 V during the switching interval is the governing
condition which establishes the other currents and voltages at t = 0 + .
Since v C (0 + ) = 100 V, and since the capacitor is in parallel with the
200 resistor, we find i(0 + ) = 0.5 ampere, A = 0.4 ampere, and thus
i(t) = 0.1923 ampere
i(t) = 0.1 + 0.4e −t/1.2

or
i(t) = 0.1923 + (−0.0923 + 0.4e −t/1.2 )u(t)

where the last expression is correct for all t.
The complete response for all t may also be written concisely by
using u(−t), which is unity for t < 0 and 0 for t > 0. Thus,
i(t) = 0.1923u(−t) + (0.1 + 0.4e −t/1.2 )u(t)
amperes
This response is sketched in Fig. 8.43b. Note that only four numbers
are needed to write the functional form of the response for this single-
energy-storage-element circuit, or to prepare the sketch: the constant
value prior to switching (0.1923 ampere), the instantaneous value just
after switching (0.5 ampere), the constant forced response (0.1 ampere),
and the time constant (1.2 s). The appropriate negative exponential
function is then easily written or drawn.

We conclude by listing the duals of the statements given at the end of
Sec. 8.7.
The procedure we have been using to find the response of an RC circuit
after dc sources have been switched on or off, or in or out of the circuit, at
some instant of time, say t = 0, is summarized in the following. We assume
that the circuit is reducible to a single equivalent resistance R eq in parallel
with a single equivalent capacitance C eq when all independent sources are
set equal to zero. The response we seek is represented by f (t).299
SECTION 8.8 DRIVEN RC CIRCUITS

With all independent sources zeroed out, simplify the circuit to
determine R eq , C eq , and the time constant τ = R eq C eq .
2. Viewing C eq as an open circuit, use dc analysis methods to find
v C (0 − ), the capacitor voltage just prior to the discontinuity.
3. Again viewing C eq as an open circuit, use dc analysis methods to
find the forced response. This is the value approached by f (t) as
t → ∞; we represent it by f (∞).
4.
5.
6.
Write the total response as the sum of the forced and natural
responses: f (t) = f (∞) + Ae −t/τ .
Find f (0 + ) by using the condition that v C (0 + ) = v C (0 − ). If
desired, C eq may be replaced by a voltage source v C (0 + ) [a short
circuit if v C (0 + ) = 0] for this calculation. With the exception of
capacitor voltages (and inductor currents), other voltages and cur-
rents in the circuit may change abruptly.
f (0 + ) = f (∞) + A and f (t) = f (∞) + [ f (0 + ) − f (∞)]e −t/τ ,
or total response = final value + (initial value − final value) e −t/τ .
As we have just seen, the same basic steps that apply to the analysis of
R L circuits can be applied to RC circuits as well. Up to now, we have con-
fined ourselves to the analysis of circuits with dc forcing functions only, de-
spite the fact that Eq. [30] holds for more general functions such as
Q(t) = 9 cos(5t − 7 o ) or Q(t) = 2e −5t . Before concluding this section, we
explore one such non-dc scenario.
EXAMPLE 8.11
Determine an expression for v(t) in the circuit of Fig. 8.45 valid
for t > 0.
Based on experience, we expect a complete response of the form
v(t) = v f + v n
where v f will likely resemble our forcing function and v n will have the
form Ae −t/τ .
What is the circuit time constant τ ? We replace our source with an
open circuit and find the Thévenin equivalent resistance in parallel with
the capacitor:
R eq = 4.7 + 10 = 14.7
Thus, our time constant is τ = R eq C = 323.4 μs, or equivalently
1/τ = 3.092 ×10 3 s −1 .
There are several ways to proceed, although perhaps the most
straightforward is to perform a source transformation, resulting in a
voltage source 23.5e −2000t u(t) V in series with 14.7 and 22 μF.
(Note this does not change the time constant.)

PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF SEQUENTIALLY
• SWITCHED CIRCUITS
In Example 8.9 we briefly considered the response of an RL circuit to a
pulse waveform, in which a source was effectively switched into and sub-
sequently switched out of the circuit. This type of situation is common in
practice, as few circuits are designed to be energized only once (passenger
vehicle airbag triggering circuits, for example). In predicting the response
of simple R L and RC circuits subjected to pulses and series of pulses—
sometimes referred to as sequentially switched circuits—the key is the rel-
ative size of the circuit time constant to the various times that define the
pulse sequence. The underlying principle behind the analysis will be whether
the energy storage element has time to fully charge before the pulse ends,
and whether it has time to fully discharge before the next pulse begins.
Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 8.47a, which is connected to a pulsed
voltage source described by seven separate parameters defined in
Fig. 8.47b. The waveform is bounded by two values, V1 and V2. The time
t r required to change from V1 to V2 is called the rise time (TR), and
the time t f required to change from V2 to V1 is called the fall time (TF).
The duration W p of the pulse is referred to as the pulse width (PW), and the
period T of the waveform (PER) is the time it takes for the pulse to repeat.
Note also that SPICE allows a time delay (TD) before the pulse train301

begins, which can be useful in allowing initial transient responses to decay
for some circuit configurations.
For the purposes of this discussion, we set a zero time delay, V1 = 0,
and V2 = 9 V. The circuit time constant is τ = RC = 1 ms, so we set the
rise and fall times to be 1 ns. Although SPICE will not allow a voltage to
change in zero time since it solves the differential equations using discrete
time intervals, compared to our circuit time constant 1 ns is a reasonable ap-
proximation to “instantaneous.”
We will consider four basic cases, summarized in Table 8.1. In the first
two cases, the pulse width W p is much longer than the circuit time constant
τ , so we expect the transients resulting from the beginning of the pulse to
die out before the pulse is over. In the latter two cases, the opposite is true:
the pulse width is so short that the capacitor does not have time to fully
charge before the pulse ends. A similar issue arises when we consider the re-
sponse of the circuit when the time between pulses (T − W p ) is either short
(Case II) or long (Case III) compared to the circuit time constant.

■ FIGURE 8.48 Capacitor voltage for the RC circuit, with pulse width and period as in (a) Case I;
(b) Case II; (c) Case III; and (d ) Case IV.
In Case I, the capacitor has time to both fully charge and fully discharge
(Fig. 8.48a), whereas in Case II (Fig. 8.48b), when the time between pulses
is reduced, it no longer has time to fully discharge. In contrast, the capaci-
tor does not have time to fully charge in either Case III (Fig. 8.48c) or
Case IV (Fig. 8.48d).
Case I: Time Enough to Fully Charge
and Fully Discharge
We can obtain exact values for the response in each case, of course, by per-
forming a series of analyses. We consider Case I first. Since the capacitor
has time to fully charge, the forced response will correspond to the 9 V dc
driving voltage. The complete response to the first pulse is therefore
v C (t) = 9 + Ae −1000t
V
With v C (0) = 0, A = −9 V and so
v C (t) = 9(1 − e −1000t )
V
[39]
in the interval of 0 < t < 10 ms. At t = 10 ms, the source drops suddenly
to 0 V, and the capacitor begins to discharge through the resistor. In this time
interval we are faced with a simple “source-free” RC circuit, and we can
write the response as
v C (t) = Be −1000(t−0.01)
10 < t < 20 ms
[40]
where B = 8.99959 V is found by substituting t = 10 ms in Eq. [39]; we
will be pragmatic here and round this to 9 V, noting that the value calculated
is consistent with our assumption that the initial transient dissipates before
the pulse ends.
At t = 20 ms, the voltage source jumps immediately back to 9 V. The
capacitor voltage just prior to this event is given by substituting t = 20 ms
in Eq. [40], leading to v C (20 ms) = 408.6 μV, essentially zero compared to
the peak value of 9 V.SECTION 8.9 PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF SEQUENTIALLY SWITCHED CIRCUITS
If we keep to our convention of rounding to four significant digits, the
capacitor voltage at the beginning of the second pulse is zero, which is the
same as our starting point. Thus, Eqs. [39] and [40] form the basis of the re-
sponse for all subsequent pulses, and we may write

Case II: Time Enough to Fully Charge But
Not Fully Discharge
Next we consider what happens if the capacitor is not allowed to completely
discharge (Case II). Equation [39] still describes the situation in the interval
of 0 < t < 10 ms, and Eq. [40] describes the capacitor voltage in the inter-
val between pulses, which has been reduced to 10 < t < 10.1 ms.
Just prior to the onset of the second pulse at t = 10.1 ms, v C is now
8.144 V; the capacitor has only had 0.1 ms to discharge, and therefore still
retains 82 percent of its maximum energy when the next pulse begins. Thus,
in the next interval,
−3
v C (t) = 9 + Ce −1000(t−10.1×10
)
10.1 < t < 20.1 ms
V
where v C (10.1 ms) = 9 + C = 8.144 V, so C = −0.856 V and
−3
v C (t) = 9 − 0.856e −1000(t−10.1×10
)
V
10.1 < t < 20.1 ms
which reaches the peak value of 9 V much more quickly than for the previ-
ous pulse.
Case III: No Time to Fully Charge But Time
to Fully Discharge
What if it isn’t clear that the transient will dissipate before the end of the volt-
age pulse? In fact, this situation arises in Case III. Just as we wrote for Case I,
v C (t) = 9 + Ae −1000t
V

still applies to this situation, but now only in the interval 0 < t < 0.1 ms.
Our initial condition has not changed, so A = −9 V as before. Now, how-
ever, just before this first pulse ends at t = 0.1 ms, we find that
v C = 0.8565 V. This is a far cry from the maximum of 9 V possible if we
allow the capacitor time to fully charge, and is a direct result of the pulse
lasting only one-tenth of the circuit time constant.
The capacitor now begins to discharge, so that

We have already determined that v C (0.1 ms) = 0.8565 V, so
v C (0.1 + ms) = 0.8565 V and substitution into Eq. [42] yields B = 0.8565 V.
Just prior to the onset of the second pulse at t = 10.1 ms, the capacitor volt-
age has decayed to essentially 0 V; this is the initial condition at the start of
the second pulse and so Eq. [41] can be rewritten as

In the last case, we consider the situation where the pulse width and period

Just prior to the onset of the second pulse at t = 0.2 ms, the capacitor
voltage has decayed to v C = 0.7750 V; with insufficient time to fully
discharge, it retains a large fraction of the little energy it had time to
store initially. For the interval of 0.2 < t < 0.3 ms, substitution of
v C (0.2 + ) = v C (0.2 − ) = 0.7750 V into Eq. [46] yields C = −8.225 V.
Continuing, we evaluate Eq. [46] at t = 0.3 ms and calculate v C = 1.558 V
just prior to the end of the second pulse. Thus, D = 1.558 V and our

SECTION 8.9 PREDICTING THE RESPONSE OF SEQUENTIALLY SWITCHED CIRCUITS
capacitor is slowly charging to ever increase voltage levels over several
pulses. At this stage it might be useful if we plot the detailed responses, so
we show the PSpice simulation results of Cases I through IV in Fig. 8.49.
Note in particular that in Fig. 8.49d, the small charge/discharge transient
response similar in shape to that shown in Fig. 8.49a–c is superimposed on
a charging-type response of the form (1 − e −t/τ ). Thus, it takes about 3 to
5 circuit time constants for the capacitor to charge to its maximum value
in situations where a single period does not allow it to fully charge or
discharge!
What we have not yet done is predict the behavior of the response for
t
5τ , although we would be interested in doing so, especially if it was not
necessary to consider a very long sequence of pulses one at a time. We note
that the response of Fig. 8.49d has an average value of 4.50 V from about
4 ms onward. This is exactly half the value we would expect if the voltage
source pulse width allowed the capacitor to fully charge. In fact, this long-
term average value can be computed by multiplying the dc capacitor volt-
age by the ratio of the pulse width to the period.

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In this chapter we learned that circuits containing a single energy storage
element (either an inductor or a capacitor) can be described by a character-
istic time scale, namely, the circuit time constant (τ = L/R, or τ = RC ,
respectively). If we attempt to change the amount of energy stored in the
element (either charging or discharging), every voltage and current in the cir-
cuit will include an exponential term of the form e −t/τ . After approximately
5 time constants from the moment we attempted to alter the amount of
stored energy, the transient response has essentially disappeared and we are
left simply with a forced response which arises from the independent
sources driving the circuit at times t > 0. When determining the forced
response in a purely dc circuit, we may treat inductors as short circuits and
capacitors as open circuits.versa), and the time delay required to convey the output
of one gate to the input of the next gate. Although tran-
sistors contain “built-in” capacitances that affect their
switching speed, it is the interconnect pathways that
presently limit the speed of the fastest digital integrated
circuits. We can model the interconnect pathway between
two logic gates using a simple RC circuit (although as
feature sizes continue to decrease in modern designs,
more detailed models are required to accurately predict
circuit performance). For example, consider a 2000 μm
long pathway 2 μm wide. We can model this pathway in
a typical silicon-based integrated circuit as having a
capacitance of 0.5 pF and a resistance of 100 , shown
schematically in Fig. 8.53.

■ FIGURE 8.53 Circuit model for an integrated circuit pathway.
Let’s assume the voltage v out represents the output
voltage of a gate that is changing from a logic “0” state
to a logic “1” state. The voltage v in appears across the in-
put of a second gate, and we are interested in how long it
takes v in to reach the same value as v out .
Assuming the 0.5 pF capacitance that characterizes
the interconnect pathway is initially discharged [i.e.,
v in (0) = 0], calculating the RC time constant for our
pathway as τ = RC = 50 ps, and defining t = 0 as
when v out changes, we obtain the expression
v in (t) = Ae −t/τ + v out (0)
Setting v in (0) = 0, we find that A = −v out (0) so that
v in (t) = v out (0)[1 − e −t/τ ]
Upon examining this equation, we see that v in will
reach the value v out (0) after ∼5τ or 250 ps. If the volt-
age v out changes again before this transient time period
is over, then the capacitance does not have sufficient
time to fully charge. In such situations, v in will be less
than v out (0). Assuming that v out (0) equals the minimum
logic “1” voltage, for example, this means that v in will
not correspond to a logic “1.” If v out now suddenly
changes to 0 V (logic “0”), the capacitance will begin to
discharge so that v in decreases further. Thus, by switch-
ing our logic states too quickly, we are unable to trans-
fer the information from one gate to another.
The fastest speed at which we can change logic
states is therefore (5τ ) −1 . This can be expressed in
terms of the maximum operating frequency:
f max =
1
= 2 GHz
2(5τ )
where the factor of 2 represents a charge/discharge pe-
riod. If we desire to operate our integrated circuit at a
higher frequency so that calculations can be performed
faster, we need to reduce the interconnect capacitance
and/or the interconnect resistance.
We started our analysis with so-called source-free circuits to introduce
the idea of time constants without unnecessary distractions; such circuits
have zero forced response and a transient response derived entirely from the
energy stored at t = 0. We reasoned that a capacitor cannot change its volt-
age in zero time (or an infinite current results), and indicated this by intro-
ducing the notation v C (0 + ) = v C (0 − ). Similarly, the current through an in-
ductor cannot change in zero time, or i L (0 + ) = i L (0 − ). The complete
response is always the sum of the transient response and the forced re-
sponse. Applying the initial condition to the complete response allows us to
determine the unknown constant which multiplies the transient term.
We spent a little time discussing modeling switches, both analytically
and within the context of PSpice. A common mathematical representation
makes use of the unit-step function u(t − t 0 ), which has zero value for
t < t 0 , unity value for t > t 0 , and is indeterminate for t = t 0 . Unit-step308
CHAPTER 8 BASIC RL AND RC CIRCUITS
functions can “activate” a circuit (connecting sources so current can flow) for
values of t preceding a specific time as well as after. Combinations of step
functions can be used to create pulses and more complex waveforms. In the
case of sequentially switched circuits, where sources are connected and dis-
connected repeatedly, we found the behavior of the circuits to depend strongly
on both period and pulse width as they compare to the circuit time constant.
This is a good time to highlight some key points worth reviewing, along
with relevant example(s).

The response of a circuit having sources suddenly switched in or out of
a circuit containing capacitors and inductors will always be composed
of two parts: a natural response and a forced response.
The form of the natural response (also referred to as the transient
response) depends only on the component values and the way they are
wired together. (Examples 8.1, 8.2)
A circuit reduced to a single equivalent capacitance C and a single
equivalent resistance R will have a natural response given by
v(t) = V 0 e −t/τ , where τ = RC is the circuit time constant.
(Examples 8.3, 8.5)
A circuit reduced to a single equivalent inductance L and a single
equivalent resistance R will have a natural response given by
i(t) = I 0 e −t/τ , where τ = L/R is the circuit time constant.
(Example 8.4)
Circuits with dependent sources can be represented by a resistance
using Thévenin procedures.
The unit-step function is a useful way to model the closing or
opening of a switch, provided we are careful to keep an eye on the
initial conditions. (Examples 8.7, 8.9)
The form of the forced response mirrors the form of the forcing
function. Therefore, a dc forcing function always leads to a constant
forced response. (Examples 8.7, 8.8)
The complete response of an RL or RC circuit excited by a dc
source will have the form f (0 + ) = f (∞) + A and f (t) = f (∞) +
[ f (0 + ) − f (∞)]e −t/τ , or total response = final value +
(initial value − final value)e −t/τ . (Examples 8.9, 8.10, 8.11)
The complete response for an RL or RC circuit may also be determined
by writing a single differential equation for the quantity of interest and
solving. (Examples 8.2, 8.11)
When dealing with sequentially switched circuits, or circuits connected
to pulsed waveforms, the relevant issue is whether the energy storage
element has sufficient time to fully charge and to fully discharge, as
measured relative to the circuit time constant.

The RLC Circuit
KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
In Chap. 8 we studied circuits which contained only one energy
storage element, combined with a passive network which partly
determined how long it took either the capacitor or the inductor to
charge/discharge. The differential equations which resulted from
analysis were always first-order. In this chapter, we consider more
complex circuits which contain both an inductor and a capacitor.
The result is a second-order differential equation for any voltage or
current of interest. What we learned in Chap. 8 is easily extended to
the study of these so-called RLC circuits, although now we need
two initial conditions to solve each differential equation. Such
circuits occur routinely in a wide variety of applications, including
oscillators and frequency filters. They are also very useful in mod-
eling a number of practical situations, such as automobile suspen-
sion systems, temperature controllers, and even the response of an
airplane to changes in elevator and aileron positions.

9.1 THE SOURCE-FREE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
•
There are two basic types of RLC circuits: parallel connected, and
series connected. We could start with either, but somewhat arbitrar-
ily choose to begin by considering parallel RLC circuits. This
particular combination of ideal elements is a reasonable model for
portions of many communication networks. It represents, for exam-
ple, an important part of certain electronic amplifiers found in
radios, and enables the amplifiers to produce a large voltage ampli-
fication over a narrow band of signal frequencies (with almost zero
amplification outside this band).
Just as we did with RL and RC circuits, we first consider the nat-
ural response of a parallel RLC circuit, where one or both of the

energy storage elements have some nonzero initial energy (the origin of
which for now is unimportant). This is represented by the inductor current
and the capacitor voltage, both specified at t = 0 + . Once we’re comfortable
with this part of RLC circuit analysis, we can easily include dc sources,
switches, or step sources in the circuit. Then we find the total response,
which will be the sum of the natural response and the forced response.
Frequency selectivity of this kind enables us to listen to the transmission
of one station while rejecting the transmission of any other station. Other ap-
plications include the use of parallel RLC circuits in frequency multiplexing
and harmonic-suppression filters. However, even a simple discussion of these
principles requires an understanding of such terms as resonance, frequency
response, and impedance, which we have not yet discussed. Let it suffice to
say, therefore, that an understanding of the natural behavior of the parallel
RLC circuit is fundamentally important to future studies of communications
networks and filter design, as well as many other applications.
When a physical capacitor is connected in parallel with an inductor and
the capacitor has associated with it a finite resistance, the resulting network
can be shown to have an equivalent circuit model like that shown in Fig. 9.1.
The presence of this resistance can be used to model energy loss in the
capacitor; over time, all real capacitors will eventually discharge, even if dis-
connected from a circuit. Energy losses in the physical inductor can also be
taken into account by adding an ideal resistor (in series with the ideal
inductor). For simplicity, however, we restrict our discussion to the case of an
essentially ideal inductor in parallel with a “leaky” capacitor.
Obtaining the Differential Equation
for a Parallel RLC Circuit
In the following analysis we will assume that energy may be stored initially
in both the inductor and the capacitor; in other words, nonzero initial values
of both inductor current and capacitor voltage may be present. With reference
to the circuit of Fig. 9.1, we may then write the single nodal equation

1 t
v dt − i(t 0 ) + C

[1]

Note that the minus sign is a consequence of the assumed direction for i.
We must solve Eq. [1] subject to the initial conditions
i(0 + ) = I 0 [2]
v(0 + ) = V 0 [3]
and
When both sides of Eq. [1] are differentiated once with respect to time, the re-
sult is the linear second-order homogeneous differential equation

whose solution v(t) is the desired natural response.
Solution of the Differential Equation
There are a number of interesting ways to solve Eq. [4]. Most of these methods
we will leave to a course in differential equations, selecting only the quickest
and simplest method to use now. We will assume a solution, relying upon ourSECTION 9.1 THE SOURCE-FREE PARALLEL CIRCUIT
intuition and modest experience to select one of the several possible forms that
are suitable. Our experience with first-order equations might suggest that we
at least try the exponential form once more. Thus, we assume
v = Ae st
[5]
being as general as possible by allowing A and s to be complex numbers if
necessary. Substituting Eq. [5] in Eq. [4], we obtain
1

CAs 2 e st + Ase st + Ae st = 0
R
L
or
1

Ae st Cs 2 + s +
R
L
In order for this equation to be satisfied for all time, at least one of the
three factors must be zero. If either of the first two factors is set equal to zero,
then v(t) = 0. This is a trivial solution of the differential equation which
cannot satisfy our given initial conditions. We therefore equate the remaining
factor to zero:
1
1
Cs 2 + s + = 0
[6]
R
L
This equation is usually called the auxiliary equation or the characteristic
equation, as we discussed in Sec. 8.1. If it can be satisfied, then our assumed
solution is correct. Since Eq. [6] is a quadratic equation, there are two solu-
tions, identified as s 1 and s 2 :

s 1 = − 1

s 2 = − − 1

LC [8]
and
If either of these two values is used for s in the assumed solution, then that
solution satisfies the given differential equation; it thus becomes a valid
solution of the differential equation.
Let us assume that we replace s by s 1 in Eq. [5], obtaining
v 1 = A 1 e s 1 t
and, similarly,
v 2 = A 2 e s 2 t

Linearity triumphs, and it is seen that the sum of the two solutions is also a
solution. We thus have the general form of the natural response
v(t) = A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t
[9]
where s 1 and s 2 are given by Eqs. [7] and [8]; A 1 and A 2 are two arbi-
trary constants which are to be selected to satisfy the two specified initial
conditions.
Definition of Frequency Terms
The form of the natural response as given in Eq. [9] offers little insight into
the nature of the curve we might obtain if v(t) were plotted as a function
of time. The relative amplitudes of A 1 and A 2 , for example, will certainly be
important in determining the shape of the response curve. Furthermore, the
constants s 1 and s 2 can be real numbers or conjugate complex numbers,
depending upon the values of R, L, and C in the given network. These two
cases will produce fundamentally different response forms. Therefore, it will
be helpful to make some simplifying substitutions in Eq. [9].
Since the exponents s 1 t and s 2 t must be dimensionless, s 1 and s 2 must
have the unit of some dimensionless quantity “per second.”
From Eqs. [7]
√
and [8] we therefore see that the units of 1/2RC and 1/ LC must also be s −1
(i.e., seconds −1 ). Units of this type are called frequencies.
Let us define a new term, ω 0 (omega-sub-zero, or just omega-zero):
ω 0 = √
1
LC
[10]
and reserve the term resonant frequency for it. On the other hand, we will call
1/2RC the neper frequency, or the exponential damping coefficient and
represent it by the symbol α (alpha):
α =
1
2RC
[11]
This latter descriptive expression is used because α is a measure of how
rapidly the natural response decays or damps out to its steady, final value
(usually zero). Finally, s, s 1 , and s 2 , which are quantities that will form the ba-
sis for some of our later work, are called complex frequencies.
We should note that s 1 , s 2 , α, and ω 0 are merely symbols used to simplify
the discussion of RLC circuits; they are not mysterious new properties of any
kind. It is easier, for example, to say “alpha” than it is to say “the reciprocal
of 2RC.”
Let us collect these results. The natural response of the parallel RLC
circuit is
v(t) = A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t
[9]
where
s 1 = −α + α 2 − ω 0 2 [12]
s 2 = −α − α 2 − ω 0 2 [13]325

The ratio of α to ω 0 is called the damping ratio by
control system engineers and is designated by ζ (zeta).
[10]
and A 1 and A 2 must be found by applying the given initial conditions.
We note two basic scenarios possible with Eqs. [12] and [13] depending
on the relative sizes of α and ω 0 (dictated by the values of R, L, and C). If
α > ω 0 , s 1 and s 2 will both be real numbers, leading to what is referred to as
an overdamped response. In the opposite case, where α < ω 0 , both s 1 and s 2
will have nonzero imaginary components, leading to what is known as an
underdamped response. Both of these situations are considered separately in
the following sections, along with the special case of α = ω 0 , which leads to
what is called a critically damped response. We should also note that the gen-
eral response comprised by Eqs. [9] through [13] describes not only the volt-
age but all three branch currents in the parallel RLC circuit; the constants A 1
and A 2 will be different for each, of course.

Critically damped:
Underdamped:

EXAMPLE 9.1
Consider a parallel RLC circuit having an inductance of 10 mH and
a capacitance of 100 μF. Determine the resistor values that would
lead to overdamped and underdamped responses.
We first calculate the resonant frequency of the circuit:

9.2 THE OVERDAMPED PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
•
A comparison of Eqs. [10] and [11] shows that α will be greater than ω 0 if
LC > 4R 2 C 2 . In this case the radical used in calculating s 1 and s 2 will be real,
and both s 1 and s 2 will be real. Moreover, the following inequalities

α 2 − ω 0 2 < −α +
α 2 − ω 0 2 < 0
may be applied to Eqs. [12] and [13] to show that both s 1 and s 2 are negative
real numbers. Thus, the response v(t) can be expressed as the (algebraic) sum
of two decreasing exponential terms, both of which approach zero as time in-
creases. In fact, since the absolute value of s 2 is larger than that of s 1 , the term
containing s 2 has the more rapid rate of decrease, and, for large values of time,
we may write the limiting expression
v(t) → A 1 e s 1 t → 0
as t → ∞
The next step is to determine the arbitrary constants A 1 and A 2 in confor-
mance with the initial conditions. We select a parallel RLC circuit with
1
R = 6 , L = 7 H, and, for ease of computation, C = 42
F. The initial energy
storage is specified by choosing an initial voltage across the circuit v(0) = 0
and an initial inductor current i(0) = 10 A, where v and i are defined in Fig. 9.2.
We may easily determine the values of the several parameters
√
α = 3.5
ω 0 = 6
(all s −1 )
s 1 = −1
s 2 = −6
and immediately write the general form of the natural response
v(t) = A 1 e −t + A 2 e −6t
[14]
Finding Values for A 1 and A 2
Only the evaluation of the two constants A 1 and A 2 remains. If we knew the
response v(t) at two different values of time, these two values could be sub-
stituted in Eq. [14] and A 1 and A 2 easily found. However, we know only one
instantaneous value of v(t),
v(0) = 0
and, therefore,
0 = A 1 + A 2
[15]
We can obtain a second equation relating A 1 and A 2 by taking the deriva-
tive of v(t) with respect to time in Eq. [14], determining the initial value of
this derivative through the use of the remaining initial condition i(0) = 10,
and equating the results. So, taking the derivative of both sides of Eq. [14],
dv
= −A 1 e −t − 6A 2 e −6t
dt
and evaluating the derivative at t = 0,
dv
dt
t=0
= −A 1 − 6A 2SECTION 9.2 THE OVERDAMPED PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
327
we obtain a second equation. Although this may appear to be helpful, we do
not have a numerical value for the initial value of the derivative, so we do not
yet have two equations in two unknowns . . . Or do we? The expression
dv/dt suggests a capacitor current, since
i C = C
dv
dt
Kirchhoff’s current law must hold at any instant in time, as it is based on
conservation of electrons. Thus, we may write
−i C (0) + i(0) + i R (0) = 0
Substituting our expression for capacitor current and dividing by C,

since zero initial voltage across the resistor requires zero initial current
through it. We thus have our second equation,
420 = −A 1 − 6A 2
[16]
and simultaneous solution of Eqs. [15] and [16] provides the two amplitudes
A 1 = 84 and A 2 = −84. Therefore, the final numerical solution for the nat-
ural response of this circuit is
v(t) = 84(e −t − e −6t )
V
For the remainder of our discussions concerning RLC
circuits, we will always require two initial conditions in
order to completely specify the response. One condition
will usually be very easy to apply—either a voltage or
current at t = 0. It is the second condition that usually
requires a little effort. Although we will often have both
an initial current and an initial voltage at our disposal,
one of these will need to be applied indirectly through
the derivative of our assumed solution.

We are asked to find the capacitor voltage after the switch is
thrown. This action leads to no sources remaining connected to
either the inductor or the capacitor.
(Continued on next page)328
CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT
᭤ Collect the known information.
After the switch is thrown, the capacitor is left in parallel with a
200 resistor and a 5 mH inductor (Fig. 9.3b). Thus, α = 1/2RC =
√
125,000 s −1 , ω 0 = 1/ LC = 100,000 rad/s, s 1 = −α + α 2 − ω 0 2 =
−50,000 s −1 and s 2 = −α −
α 2 − ω 0 2 = −200,000 s −1 .
᭤ Devise a plan.
Since α > ω 0 , the circuit is overdamped and so we expect a capacitor
voltage of the form
v C (t) = A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t
We know s 1 and s 2 ; we need to obtain and invoke two initial condi-
tions to determine A 1 and A 2 . To do this, we will analyze the circuit at
t = 0 − (Fig. 9.4a) to find i L (0 − ) and v C (0 − ). We will then analyze
the circuit at t = 0 + with the assumption that neither value changes.
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.
From Fig. 9.4a, in which the inductor has been replaced with a short
circuit and the capacitor with an open circuit, we see that

In Fig. 9.4b, we draw the circuit at t = 0 + , representing the inductor
current and capacitor voltage by ideal sources for simplicity. Since
neither can change in zero time, we know that v C (0 + ) = 60 V.
᭤ Determine if additional information is required.
We have an equation for the capacitor voltage: v C (t) = A 1 e −50,000t +
A 2 e −200 , 000t . We now know v C (0) = 60 V, but a third equation is still
required. Differentiating our capacitor voltage equation, we find
dv C
= −50,000A 1 e −50,000t − 200,000A 2 e −200,000t
dt
which can be related to the capacitor current as i C = C(dv C /dt).
Returning to Fig. 9.4b, KCL yields
i C (0 + ) = −i L (0 + ) − i R (0 + ) = 0.3 − [v C (0 + )/200] = 0
᭤ Attempt a solution.
Application of our first initial condition yields
v C (0) = A 1 + A 2 = 60
and application of our second initial condition yields
i C (0) = −20 × 10 −9 (50,000A 1 + 200,000A 2 ) = 0
Solving, A 1 = 80 V and A 2 = −20 V, so that
v C (t) = 80e −50,000t − 20e −200,000t V,
t > 0
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
At the very least, we can check our solution at t = 0, verifying that
v C (0) = 60 V. Differentiating and multiplying by 20 × 10 −9 , we can
also verify that i C (0) = 0. Also, since we have a source-free circuit
for t > 0, we expect that v C (t) must eventually decay to zero as t
approaches ∞, which our solution does.

As noted previously, the form of the overdamped response applies to any
voltage or current quantity, as we explore in the following example.

circuit for t = 0 − . (c) Equivalent circuit for t = 0 + .
For t > 0, we have a parallel RLC circuit with R = 30 k , L = 12 mH,
and C = 2 pF. Thus, α = 8.333 × 10 6 s −1 and ω 0 = 6.455 × 10 6 rad/s.
We therefore expect an overdamped response, with s 1 = −3.063 ×
10 6 s −1 and s 2 = −13.60 × 10 6 s −1 , so that
i R (t) = A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t ,
t > 0
[18]
To determine numerical values for A 1 and A 2 , we first analyze the
circuit at t = 0 − , as drawn in Fig. 9.6b. We see that i L (0 − ) = i R (0 − ) =
4/32 × 10 3 = 125 μA, and v C (0 − ) = 4 × 30/32 = 3.75 V.
In drawing the circuit at t = 0 + (Fig. 9.6c), we only know that
i L (0 + ) = 125 μA and v C (0 + ) = 3.75 V. However, by Ohm’s law we
can calculate that i R (0 + ) = 3.75/30 × 10 3 = 125 μA, our first initial
condition. Thus,
i R (0) = A 1 + A 2 = 125 × 10 −6
[19]331
SECTION 9.2 THE OVERDAMPED PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
How do we obtain a second initial condition? If we multiply Eq. [18]
by 30 × 10 3 , we obtain an expression for v C (t). Taking the derivative
and multiplying by 2 pF yield an expression for i C (t):
i C = C
dv C
= (2 × 10 −12 )(30 × 10 3 )(A 1 s 1 e s 1 t + A 2 s 2 e s 2 t )

By KCL,
i C (0 + ) = i L (0 + ) − i R (0 + ) = 0
Thus,
−(2 × 10 −12 )(30 × 10 3 )(3.063 × 10 6 A 1 + 13.60 × 10 6 A 2 ) = 0
[20]
Solving Eqs. [19] and [20], we find that A 1 = 161.3 μA and
A 2 = −36.34 μA. Thus,

Graphical Representation of the
Overdamped Response
Now let us return to Eq. [17] and see what additional information we can de-
termine about this circuit. We may interpret the first exponential term as hav-
ing a time constant of 1 s and the other exponential, a time constant of 16 s.
Each starts with unity amplitude, but the latter decays more rapidly; v(t) is
never negative. As time becomes infinite, each term approaches zero, and the
response itself dies out as it should. We therefore have a response curve
which is zero at t = 0, is zero at t = ∞, and is never negative; since it is not
everywhere zero, it must possess at least one maximum, and this is not a
difficult point to determine exactly. We differentiate the response
dv
= 84(−e −t + 6e −6t )
dt
set the derivative equal to zero to determine the time t m at which the voltage
becomes maximum,
0 = −e −t m + 6e −6t m

A reasonable sketch of the response may be made by plotting the two
exponential terms 84e −t and 84e −6t and then taking their difference. This
technique is illustrated by the curves of Fig. 9.8; the two exponentials are
shown lightly, and their difference, the total response v(t), is drawn as a col-
ored line. The curves also verify our previous prediction that the functional
behavior of v(t) for very large t is 84e −t , the exponential term containing the
smaller magnitude of s 1 and s 2 .

A frequently asked question is the length of time it actually takes for the
transient part of the response to disappear (or “damp out”). In practice, it is
often desirable to have this transient response approach zero as rapidly as
possible, that is, to minimize the settling time t s . Theoretically, of course, t s
is infinite, because v(t) never settles to zero in a finite time. However, a neg-
ligible response is present after the magnitude of v(t) has settled to values
that remain less than 1 percent of its maximum absolute value |v m |. The
time that is required for this to occur we define as the settling time. Since
|v m | = v m = 48.9 V for our example, the settling time is the time required
for the response to drop to 0.489 V. Substituting this value for v(t) in
Eq. [17] and neglecting the second exponential term, known to be negligi-
ble here, the settling time is found to be 5.15 s.
EXAMPLE 9.4
For t > 0, the capacitor current of a certain source-free parallel
RLC circuit is given by i C (t) 2e −2t − 4e −t A. Sketch the current
in the range 0 < t < 5 s, and determine the settling time.
We first sketch the two terms as shown in Fig. 9.9, then subtract them
to find i C (t). The maximum value is clearly |−2| = 2 A. We therefore
need to find the time at which |i C | has decreased to 20 mA, or

9.3 CRITICAL DAMPING
•
The overdamped case is characterized by
α > ω 0
or
LC > 4R 2 C 2
“Impossible” is a pretty strong term. We make this
statement because in practice it is unusual to obtain
components that are closer than 1 percent of their
specified values. Thus, obtaining L precisely equal to
4R 2 C is theoretically possible, but not very likely, even
if we’re willing to measure a drawer full of components
until we find the right ones.
and leads to negative real values for s 1 and s 2 and to a response expressed as
the algebraic sum of two negative exponentials.
Now let us adjust the element values until α and ω 0 are equal. This is a
very special case which is termed critical damping. If we were to attempt to
construct a parallel RLC circuit that is critically damped, we would be at-
tempting an essentially impossible task, for we could never make α exactly
equal to ω 0 . For completeness, however, we will discuss the critically
damped circuit here, because it shows an interesting transition between
overdamping and underdamping.
Critical damping is achieved when
or
α = ω 0
LC = 4R 2 C 2
L = 4R 2 C
critical damping
We can produce critical damping by changing the value of any of the three
elements in the numerical example discussed at the end of Sec. 9.1. We will
select R, increasing its value until critical damping
is obtained, and thus leave
√
ω 0 unchanged. The necessary value of R is 7 6/2 ; L is still 7 H, and C re-
1
mains 42
F. We thus find
√
α = ω 0 = 6 s −1
√
s 1 = s 2 = − 6 s −1
and recall the initial conditions that were specified, v(0) = 0 and i(0) =
10 A.
Form of a Critically Damped Response
We proceed to attempt to construct a response as the sum of two exponentials,
√
6t
v(t) = A 1 e −
?
√
6t
+ A 2 e −
which may be written as
√
6t
v(t) = A 3 e −
?
At this point, some of us might be feeling that something’s wrong. We
have a response that contains only one arbitrary constant, but there are two
initial conditions, v(0) = 0 and i(0) = 10 amperes, both of which must be
satisfied by this single constant. If we select A 3 = 0, then v(t) = 0, which is
consistent with our initial capacitor voltage. However, although there is no
energy stored in the capacitor at t = 0 + , we have 350 J of energy initially
stored in the inductor. This energy will lead to a transient current flowing out
of the inductor, giving rise to a nonzero voltage across all three elements. This
seems to be in direct conflict with our proposed solution.SECTION 9.3 CRITICAL DAMPING
If a mistake has not led to our difficulties, we must have begun with an
incorrect assumption, and only one assumption has been made. We originally
hypothesized that the differential equation could be solved by assuming an
exponential solution, and this turns out to be incorrect for this single special
case of critical damping. When α = ω 0 , the differential equation, Eq. [4],
becomes
d 2 v
dv
+ 2α
+ α 2 v = 0
dt 2
dt
The solution of this equation is not a tremendously difficult process, but
we will avoid developing it here, since the equation is a standard type found
in the usual differential-equation texts. The solution is
v = e −αt (A 1 t + A 2 )
[24]
It should be noted that the solution is still expressed as the sum of two
terms, where one term is the familiar negative exponential and the second is
t times a negative exponential. We should also note that the solution contains
the two expected arbitrary constants.
Finding Values for A 1 and A 2
Let us now complete our numerical example. After we substitute the known
value of α in Eq. [24], obtaining
√

v = A 1 te −
√
6t
+ A 2 e −
we establish the values of A 1 and A 2 by first imposing the initial condition on
v(t) itself, v(0) = 0. Thus, A 2 = 0. This simple result occurs because the ini-
tial value of the response v(t) was selected as zero; the more general case will
require the solution of two equations simultaneously. The second initial con-
dition must be applied to the derivative dv/dt just as in the overdamped case.
We therefore differentiate, remembering that A 2 = 0:

Graphical Representation of the Critically
Damped Response
Before plotting this response in detail, let us again try to anticipate its form by
qualitative reasoning. The specified initial value is zero, and Eq. [25] con-
curs. It is not immediately apparent that the response also approaches zero as
t becomes infinitely large, because te −2.45t is an indeterminate form. How-
ever, this obstacle is easily overcome by use of L’Hôspital’s rule, which
yields

and once again we have a response that begins and ends at zero and has posi-
tive values at all other times. A maximum value v m again occurs at time t m ; for
our example,
t m = 0.408 s
and
v m = 63.1 V
This maximum is larger than that obtained in the overdamped case, and is
a result of the smaller losses that occur in the larger resistor; the time of the
maximum response is slightly later than it was with overdamping. The set-
tling time may also be determined by solving
v m
= 420t s e −2.45t s
100
for t s (by trial-and-error methods or a calculator’s SOLVE routine):
t s = 3.12 s
which is a considerably smaller value than that which arose in the over-
damped case (5.15 s). As a matter of fact, it can be shown that, for given val-
ues of L and C, the selection of that value of R which provides critical damp-
ing will always give a shorter settling time than any choice of R that produces
an overdamped response. However, a slight improvement (reduction) in set-
tling time may be obtained by a further slight increase in resistance; a slightly
underdamped response that will undershoot the zero axis before it dies out
will yield the shortest settling time.

v(0 − ) = 5R 2

After the switch is thrown, the current source has turned itself off

9.4 THE UNDERDAMPED PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
•
Let us continue the process begun in Sec. 9.3 by increasing R once more to
obtain what we will refer to as an underdamped response. Thus, the damping
coefficient α decreases while ω 0 remains constant, α 2 becomes smaller than
ω 0 2 , and the radicand appearing in the expressions for s 1 and s 2 becomes neg-
ative. This causes the response to take on a much different character, but it is
fortunately not necessary to return to the basic differential equation again. By
using complex numbers, the exponential response turns into a damped sinu-
soidal response; this response is composed entirely of real quantities, the
complex quantities being necessary only for the derivation. 1
The Form of the Underdamped Response
We begin with the exponential form
v(t) = A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t
where
s 1,2 = −α ±
and then let
Electrical engineers use “j” instead of “i” to represent
√
−1 to avoid confusion with currents.
α 2 − ω 0 2 =
α 2 − ω 0 2
√
−1 ω 0 2 − α 2 = j ω 0 2 − α 2
√
where j ≡ −1.
We now take the new radical, which is real for the underdamped case, and
call it ω d , the natural resonant frequency:
ω d =
ω 0 2 − α 2
The response may now be written as
v(t) = e −αt (A 1 e jω d t + A 2 e − jω d t )
(1) A review of complex numbers is presented in Appendix 5.
[26]SECTION 9.4 THE UNDERDAMPED PARALLEL RLC CIRCUIT
or, in the longer but equivalent form,
v(t) = e −αt (A 1 + A 2 )
e jω d t + e − jω d t
e jω d t − e − jω d t
+ j (A 1 − A 2 )
2
j2
Applying identities described in Appendix 5, the term in the first square
brackets in the preceding equation is identically equal to cos ω d t, and the sec-
ond is identically sin ω d t. Hence,
v(t) = e −αt [(A 1 + A 2 ) cos ω d t + j (A 1 − A 2 ) sin ω d t]
and the multiplying factors may be assigned new symbols:
v(t) = e −αt (B 1 cos ω d t + B 2 sin ω d t)
[27]
where Eqs. [26] and [27] are identical.
It may seem a little odd that our expression originally appeared to have a
complex component, and now is purely real. However, we should remember
that we originally allowed for A 1 and A 2 to be complex as well as s 1 and s 2 . In
any event, if we are dealing with the underdamped case, we have now left
complex numbers behind. This must be true since α, ω d , and t are real quan-
tities, so that v(t) itself must be a real quantity (which might be presented on
an oscilloscope, a voltmeter, or a sheet of graph paper). Equation [27] is the
desired functional form for the underdamped response, and its validity may
be checked by direct substitution in the original differential equation; this
exercise is left to the doubters. The two real constants B 1 and B 2 are again
selected to fit the given initial conditions.
We return to our simple parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 9.2 with R = 6 ,
C = 1/42 F, and L = 7 H, but now increase the resistance further to 10.5 .

Graphical Representation of the Underdamped
Response
Notice that, as before, this response function has an initial value of zero
because of the initial voltage condition we imposed, and a final value of zero
because the exponential term vanishes for large values of t. As √ t increases
√
from zero through small positive values, v(t) increases as 210 2 sin 2t ,
because the exponential term remains essentially equal to unity. But, at some
time √ t m , the exponential function begins to decrease more rapidly than
sin 2t is increasing; thus v(t) reaches a maximum v m and begins
√ to de-
crease. We should note that t m is not the value √
of t for which sin 2t is a
maximum, but must
√ occur somewhat before sin 2t reaches
√ its maximum.
√
π/
2 < t < 2π,
When t = π/ 2, v(t) is zero. Thus, in the interval
√
the response is negative, becoming zero again at t = 2π. Hence, v(t) is an
oscillatory function
√ of time and crosses the time axis an infinite number of
times at t = nπ/ 2, where n is any positive integer. In our example, how-
ever, the response is only slightly underdamped, and the exponential term
causes the function to die out so rapidly that most of the zero crossings will
not be evident in a sketch.
The oscillatory nature of the response becomes more noticeable as α de-
creases. If α is zero, which corresponds to an infinitely large resistance, then
v(t) is an undamped sinusoid that oscillates with constant amplitude. There
is never a time at which v(t) drops and stays below 1 percent of its maximum
value; the settling time is therefore infinite. This is not perpetual motion; we
have merely assumed an initial energy in the circuit and have not provided
any means to dissipate this energy. It is transferred from its initial location in
the inductor to the capacitor, then returns to the inductor, and so on, forever.
The Role of Finite Resistance
A finite R in the parallel RLC circuit acts as a kind of electrical transfer agent.
Every time energy is transferred from L to C or from C to L, the agent exacts a
commission. Before long, the agent has taken all the energy, wantonly dissi-
pating every last joule. The L and C are left without a joule of their own, with-
out voltage and without current. Actual parallel RLC circuits can be made to
have effective values of R so large that a natural undamped sinusoidal re-
sponse can be maintained for years without supplying any additional energy.
Returning to our specific numerical problem, differentiation locates the
first maximum of v(t),
v m 1 = 71.8 V
t m 1 = 0.435 s
at
the succeeding minimum,
v m 2 = −0.845 V

curves for increasingly more underdamped circuits are shown in Fig. 9.15.

resistance values, showing an increase in the oscillatory behavior as R is increased.
The settling time may be obtained by a trial-and-error solution, and for
R = 10.5 , it turns out to be 2.92 s, somewhat smaller than for critical
damping. Note that t s is greater than t m 2 because the magnitude of v m 2 is
greater than 1 percent of the magnitude of v m 1 . This suggests that a slight de-
crease in R would reduce the magnitude of the undershoot and permit t s to be
less than t m 2 .
The overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped responses for
this network as simulated by PSpice are shown on the same graph in
Fig. 9.16. A comparison of the three curves makes the following general

conclusions plausible:
•
•
When the damping is changed by increasing the size of the parallel
resistance, the maximum magnitude of the response is greater and the
amount of damping is smaller.
The response becomes oscillatory when underdamping is present, and
the minimum settling time is obtained for slight underdamping.
EXAMPLE 9.6
Determine i L (t) for the circuit of Fig. 9.17a, and plot the waveform.
At t = 0, both the 3 A source and the 48 resistor are removed,
leaving the circuit shown in Fig. 9.17b. Thus, α = 1.2 s −1 and
ω 0 = 4.899 rad/s. Since α < ω 0 , the circuit is underdamped, and
we therefore expect a response of the form
i L (t) = e −αt (B 1 cos ω d t + B 2 sin ω d t)
[28]
where ω d = ω 0 2 − α 2 = 4.750 rad/s. The only remaining step is to
find B 1 and B 2 .
Figure 9.17c shows the circuit as it exists at t = 0 − . We may replace
the inductor with a short circuit and the capacitor with an open circuit;
the result is v C (0 − ) = 97.30 V and i L (0 − ) = 2.027 A. Since neither
quantity can change in zero time, v C (0 + ) = 97.30 V and
i L (0 + ) = 2.027 A.
Substituting i L (0) = 2.027 into Eq. [28] yields B 1 = 2.027 A. To
determine the other constant, we first differentiate Eq. [28]:

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
One useful feature in Probe is the ability to perform mathematical opera-
tions on the voltages and currents that result from a simulation. In this
example, we will make use of that ability to show the transfer of energy
in a parallel RLC circuit from a capacitor that initially stores a specific
amount of energy (1.25 μJ) to an inductor that initially stores no energy.
We choose a 100 nF capacitor and a 7 μH inductor, which immedi-
ately enables us to calculate ω 0 = 1.195 × 10 6 s −1 . In order to consider
overdamped, critically damped, and underdamped cases, we need to
select the parallel resistance in such a way as to obtain α > ω 0 (over-
damped), α = ω 0 (critically damped), and α < ω 0 (underdamped).
From our previous discussions, we know that for a parallel RLC circuit
α = (2RC) −1 . We select R = 4.1833 as a close approximation to the
critically damped case; obtaining α precisely equal to ω 0 is effectively
impossible. If we increase the resistance, the energy stored in the other
two elements is dissipated more slowly, resulting in an underdamped
response. We select R = 100 so that we are well into this regime, and
use R = 1 (a very small resistance) to obtain an overdamped response.
We therefore plan to run three separate simulations, varying only the
resistance R between them. The 1.25 μJ of energy initially stored in the
capacitor equates to an initial voltage of 5 V, and so we set the initial
condition of our capacitor accordingly.
Once Probe is launched, we select Add under the Trace menu. We
wish to plot the energy stored in both the inductor and the capacitor as
a function of time. For the capacitor, w = 12 Cv 2 , so we click in the
Trace Expression window, type in “0.5*100E-9*” (without the
quotes), click on V(C1:1), return to the Trace Expression window and
enter “*”, click on V(C1:1) once again, and then select Ok. We repeat
the sequence to obtain the energy stored in the inductor, using 7E-6
instead of 100E-9, and clicking on I(L1:1) instead of V(C1:1).345
SECTION 9.5 THE SOURCE-FREE SERIES RLC CIRCUIT
The Probe output plots for three separate simulations are provided in
Fig. 9.20. In Fig. 9.20a, we see that the energy remaining in the circuit is
continuously transferred back and forth between the capacitor and the
inductor until it is (eventually) completely dissipated by the resistor.
Decreasing the resistance to 4.1833 yields a critically damped circuit,
resulting in the energy plot of Fig. 9.20b. The oscillatory energy transfer
between the capacitor and the inductor has been dramatically reduced. We
see that the energy transferred to the inductor peaks at approximately
0.8 μs, and then drops to zero. The overdamped response is plotted in
Fig. 9.20c. We note that the energy is dissipated much more quickly in the
case of the overdamped response, and that very little energy is transferred
to the inductor, since most of it is now quickly dissipated in the resistor.

We now wish to determine the natural response of a circuit model composed
of an ideal resistor, an ideal inductor, and an ideal capacitor connected in
series. The ideal resistor may represent a physical resistor connected into a
series LC or RLC circuit; it may represent the ohmic losses and the losses in
the ferromagnetic core of the inductor; or it may be used to represent all these
and other energy-absorbing devices.

Our complete discussion of the parallel RLC circuit is directly applicable
to the series RLC circuit; the initial conditions on capacitor voltage and in-
ductor current are equivalent to the initial conditions on inductor current and
capacitor voltage; the voltage response becomes a current response. It is
therefore possible to reread the previous four sections using dual language
and thereby obtain a complete description of the series RLC circuit. This
process, however, is apt to induce a mild neurosis after the first few para-
graphs and does not really seem to be necessary.
A Brief Résumé of the Series Circuit Response

It is evident that if we work in terms of the parameters α, ω 0 , and ω d , the
mathematical forms of the responses for the dual situations are identical. An
increase in α in either the series or parallel circuit, while keeping ω 0 constant,
tends toward an overdamped response. The only caution that we need exert is
in the computation of α, which is 1/2RC for the parallel circuit and R/2L for
the series circuit; thus, α is increased by increasing the series resistance or de-
creasing the parallel resistance. The key equations for parallel and series RLC
circuits are summarized in Table 9.1 for convenience.

Given the series RLC circuit of Fig. 9.22 in which L = 1 H,
R = 2 k , C = 1/401 μF, i(0) = 2 mA, and v C (0) = 2 V, find and
sketch i(t), t > 0.
√
We find that α = R/2L = 1000 s −1 and ω 0 = 1/ LC = 20,025 rad/s.
This indicates an underdamped response; we therefore calculate the
value of ω d and obtain 20,000 rad/s. Except for the evaluation of the
two arbitrary constants, the response is now known:
i(t) = e −1000t (B 1 cos 20,000t + B 2 sin 20,000t)
Since we know that i(0) = 2 mA, we may substitute this value into
our equation for i(t) to obtain
B 1 = 0.002 A
and thus
i(t) = e −1000t (0.002 cos 20,000t + B 2 sin 20,000t)

The graphical construction is simplified by drawing in the envelope, shown as

The settling time can be determined easily here by using the upper

of its maximum value, 2 mA. Thus, e −1000t s = 0.01, and t s = 4.61 ms is
the approximate value that is usually used.SECTION 9.5 THE SOURCE-FREE SERIES RLC CIRCUIT

As a final example, we pause to consider situations where the circuit in-
cludes a dependent source. If no controlling current or voltage associated with
the dependent source is of interest, we may simply find the Thévenin equiva-
lent connected to the inductor and capacitor. Otherwise, we are likely faced
with having to write an appropriate integrodifferential equation, take the indi-
cated derivative, and solve the resulting differential equation as best we can.

inductor and capacitor at t = 0 + . We do this by connecting a 1 A source
as shown in Fig. 9.25b, from which we deduce that
v test = 11i − 3i = 8i = 8(1) = 8 V
√
Thus, R eq = 8 , so α = R/2L = 0.8 s −1 and ω 0 = 1/ LC =
10 rad/s, meaning that we expect an underdamped response with
ω d = 9.968 rad/s and the form
v C (t) = e −0.8t (B 1 cos 9.968t + B 2 sin 9.968t)
[32]
In considering the circuit at t = 0 − , we note that i L (0 − ) = 0 due to
the presence of the capacitor. By Ohm’s law, i(0 − ) = 5 A, so
v C (0 + ) = v C (0 − ) = 10 − 3i = 10 − 15 = −5 V
This last condition substituted into Eq. [32] yields B 1 = −5 V. Taking
the derivative of Eq. [32] and evaluating at t = 0 yield

Thus, making use of the fact that i(0 + ) = i L (0 − ) = 0 in Eq. [33] yields

9.6 THE COMPLETE RESPONSE OF THE RLC CIRCUIT
•
We now consider those RLC circuits in which dc sources are switched into the
network and produce forced responses that do not necessarily vanish as time
becomes infinite.
The general solution is obtained by the same procedure that was fol-
lowed for RL and RC circuits. The basic steps are (not necessarily in this
order) as follows:
1. Determine the initial conditions.
2. Obtain a numerical value for the forced response.
3. Write the appropriate form of the natural response with the necessary
number of arbitrary constants.
4. Add the forced response and natural response to form the complete
response.
5. Evaluate the response and its derivative at t = 0, and employ the ini-
tial conditions to solve for the values of the unknown constants.
We note that it is generally this last step that causes the most trouble for stu-
dents, as the circuit must be carefully evaluated at t = 0 to make full use of
the initial conditions. Consequently, although the determination of the initial
conditions is basically no different for a circuit containing dc sources from
what it is for the source-free circuits that we have already covered in some de-
tail, this topic will receive particular emphasis in the examples that follow.
Most of the confusion in determining and applying the initial conditions
arises for the simple reason that we do not have a rigorous set of rules laid
down for us to follow. At some point in each analysis, a situation usually
arises in which some thinking is involved that is more or less unique to that
particular problem. This is almost always the source of the difficulty.
The Easy Part
The complete response (arbitrarily assumed to be a voltage response) of a
second-order system consists of a forced response,
v f (t) = V f
351352
CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT
which is a constant for dc excitation, and a natural response,
v n (t) = Ae s 1 t + Be s 2 t
Thus,
v(t) = V f + Ae s 1 t + Be s 2 t
We assume that s 1 , s 2 , and V f have already been determined from the cir-
cuit and the given forcing functions; A and B remain to be found. The last
equation shows the functional interdependence of A, B, v, and t; and substitu-
tion of the known value of v at t = 0 + thus provides us with a single equation
relating A and B, v(0 + ) = V f + A + B. This is the easy part.
The Other Part
Another relationship between A and B is necessary, unfortunately, and this is
normally obtained by taking the derivative of the response,
dv
= 0 + s 1 Ae s 1 t + s 2 Be s 2 t
dt
and inserting the known value of dv/dt at t = 0 + . We thus have two equa-
tions relating A and B, and these may be solved simultaneously to evaluate
the two constants.
The only remaining problem is that of determining the values of v and
dv/dt at t = 0 + . Let us suppose that v is a capacitor voltage, v C . Since
i C = C dv C /dt, we should recognize the relationship between the initial
value of dv/dt and the initial value of some capacitor current. If we can es-
tablish a value for this initial capacitor current, then we will automatically es-
tablish the value of dv/dt. Students are usually able to get v(0 + ) very easily,
but are inclined to stumble a bit in finding the initial value of dv/dt. If we had
selected an inductor current i L as our response, then the initial value of di L /dt
would be intimately related to the initial value of some inductor voltage. Vari-
ables other than capacitor voltages and inductor currents are determined by
expressing their initial values and the initial values of their derivatives in
terms of the corresponding values for v C and i L .
We will illustrate the procedure and find all these values by the careful
analysis of the circuit shown in Fig. 9.28. To simplify the analysis, an unusual
value of capacitance is used again.

EXAMPLE 9.9
There are three passive elements in the circuit shown in Fig. 9.28a,
and a voltage and a current are defined for each. Find the values of
these six quantities at both t 0 − and t 0 + .
Our object is to find the value of each current and voltage at both
t = 0 − and t = 0 + . Once these quantities are known, the initial values
of the derivatives may be found easily.
1. t = 0 − At t = 0 − , only the right-hand current source is active as
depicted in Fig. 9.28b. The circuit is assumed to have been in this state
forever, so all currents and voltages are constant. Thus, a dc current
through the inductor requires zero voltage across it:
v L (0 − ) = 0
and a dc voltage across the capacitor (−v R ) requires zero current
through it:
i C (0 − ) = 0
We next apply Kirchhoff’s current law to the right-hand node to obtain
i R (0 − ) = −5 A
which also yields
v R (0 − ) = −150 V
We may now use Kirchhoff’s voltage law around the left-hand mesh,
finding
v C (0 − ) = 150 V
while KCL enables us to find the inductor current,
i L (0 − ) = 5 A
2. t = 0 + During the interval from t = 0 − to t = 0 + , the left-hand
current source becomes active and many of the voltage and current
values at t = 0 − will change abruptly. The corresponding circuit is
shown in Fig. 9.28c. However, we should begin by focusing our
attention on those quantities which cannot change, namely, the
inductor current and the capacitor voltage. Both of these must remain
constant during the switching interval. Thus,
i L (0 + ) = 5 A
and
v C (0 + ) = 150 V
Since two currents are now known at the left node, we next obtain
i R (0 + ) = −1 A and v R (0 + ) = −30 V
i C (0 + ) = 4 A and v L (0 + ) = 120 V
so that
and we have our six initial values at t = 0 − and six more at t = 0 + .
Among these last six values, only the capacitor voltage and the inductor
current are unchanged from the t = 0 − values.354
CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT
We could have employed a slightly different method to evaluate these
currents and voltages at t = 0 − and t = 0 + . Prior to the switching
operation, only direct currents and voltages exist in the circuit. The inductor
may therefore be replaced by a short circuit, its dc equivalent, while the
capacitor is replaced by an open circuit. Redrawn in this manner, the cir-
cuit of Fig. 9.28a appears as shown in Fig. 9.29a. Only the current source
at the right is active, and its 5 A flow through the resistor and the inductor.
We therefore have i R (0 − ) = −5 A and v R (0 − ) = −150 V, i L (0 − ) = 5 A
and v L (0 − ) = 0, and i C (0 − ) = 0 and v C (0 − ) = 150 V, as before.

■ FIGURE 9.29 (a) A simple circuit equivalent to the circuit of Fig. 9.28a for t = 0 − . (b) Equivalent
circuit with labeled voltages and currents valid at the instant defined by t = 0 + .
We now turn to the problem of drawing an equivalent circuit that will
assist us in determining the several voltages and currents at t = 0 + . Each
capacitor voltage and each inductor current must remain constant during
the switching interval. These conditions are ensured by replacing the induc-
tor with a current source and the capacitor with a voltage source. Each
source serves to maintain a constant response during the discontinuity. The
equivalent circuit of Fig. 9.29b results. It should be noted that the circuit
shown in Fig. 9.29b is valid only for the interval between 0 − and 0 + .
The voltages and currents at t = 0 + are obtained by analyzing this dc
circuit. The solution is not difficult, but the relatively large number of
sources present in the network does produce a somewhat strange sight.
However, problems of this type were solved in Chap. 3, and nothing new is
involved. Attacking the currents first, we begin at the upper left node and
see that i R (0 + ) = 4 − 5 = −1 A. Moving to the upper right node, we find
that i C (0 + ) = −1 + 5 = 4 A. And, of course, i L (0 + ) = 5 A.
Next we consider the voltages. Using Ohm’s law, we see that v R (0 + ) =
30(−1) = −30 V. For the inductor, KVL gives us v L (0 + ) = −30 + 150 =
120 V. Finally, including v C (0 + ) = 150 V, we have all the values at t = 0 + .SECTION 9.6 THE COMPLETE RESPONSE OF THE RLC CIRCUIT

Before leaving this problem of the determination of the necessary initial
values, we should point out that at least one other powerful method of deter-
mining them has been omitted: we could have written general nodal or loop
equations for the original circuit. Then the substitution of the known zero
values of inductor voltage and capacitor current at t = 0 − would uncover
several other response values at t = 0 − and enable the remainder to be found
easily. A similar analysis at t = 0 + must then be made. This is an important
method, and it becomes a necessary one in more complicated circuits which
cannot be analyzed by our simpler step-by-step procedures.
Now let us briefly complete the determination of the response v C (t) for
the original circuit of Fig. 9.31. With both sources dead, the circuit appears as
a series RLC circuit and s 1 and s 2 are easily found to be −1 and −9, respec-
tively. The forced response may be found by inspection or, if necessary, by
drawing the dc equivalent, which is similar to Fig. 9.29a, with the addition of
a 4 A current source. The forced response is 150 V. Thus,
v C (t) = 150 + Ae −t + Be −9t
and
v C (0 + ) = 150 = 150 + A + B
or
A + B = 0
Then,

A Quick Summary of the Solution Process
In summary, then, whenever we wish to determine the transient behavior of a
simple three-element RLC circuit, we must first decide whether we are con-
fronted with a series or a parallel circuit, so that we may use the correct rela-
tionship for α. The two equations are
1
α =
(parallel R LC)
2RC
α =
R
2L
(series R LC)
Our second decision is made after comparing α with ω 0 , which is given for
either circuit by
1
ω 0 = √
LC
If α > ω 0 , the circuit is overdamped, and the natural response has the form
f n (t) = A 1 e s 1 t + A 2 e s 2 t
where
s 1,2 = −α ±
α 2 − ω 0 2
If α = ω 0 , then the circuit is critically damped and
f n (t) = e −αt (A 1 t + A 2 )
And finally, if α < ω 0 , then we are faced with the underdamped response,
f n (t) = e −αt (A 1 cos ω d t + A 2 sin ω d t)
where
ω d =
ω 0 2 − α 2
Our last decision depends on the independent sources. If there are none
acting in the circuit after the switching or discontinuity is completed, then the
circuit is source-free and the natural response accounts for the complete re-
sponse. If independent sources are still present, then the circuit is driven and
a forced response must be determined. The complete response is then the sum
f (t) = f f (t) + f n (t)
This is applicable to any current or voltage in the circuit. Our final step is to
solve for unknown constants given the initial conditions.

Modeling Automotive Suspension Systems
Earlier, we alluded to the fact that the concepts investi-
gated in this chapter actually extend beyond the analysis
of electric circuits. In fact, the general form of the differ-
ential equations we have been working with appears in
many fields—we need only learn how to “translate’’ new
parameter terminology. For example, consider a simple
automotive suspension, as shown in Fig. 9.32. The pis-
ton is not attached to the cylinder, but is attached to both
the spring and the wheel. The moving parts therefore are
the spring, the piston, and the wheel.
We will model this physical system by first determin-
ing the forces in play. Defining a position function p(t)
which describes where the piston lies within the cylin-
der, we may write F S , the force on the spring, as
F S = K p(t)
where K is known as the spring constant and has units of
lb/ft. The force on the wheel F W is equal to the mass of
the wheel times its acceleration, or
d 2 p(t)
F W = m
dt 2
where m is measured in lb · s 2 /ft. Last but not least is the
force of friction F f acting on the piston
F f = μ f

where μ f is the coefficient of friction, with units of

forces acting in our system must sum to zero, so that

[34]
This equation most likely had the potential to give us
nightmares at one point in our academic career, but no
longer. We compare Eq. [32] to Eqs. [30] and [31] and
immediately see a distinct resemblance, at least in the
general form. Choosing Eq. [30], the differential equa-
tion describing the inductor current of a series-connected
RLC circuit, we observe the following correspondences:

So, if we are willing to talk about feet instead of am-
peres, lb · s 2 /ft instead of H, ft/lb instead of F, and lb · s/ft
instead of , we can apply our newly found skills at
modeling RLC circuits to the task of evaluating automo-
tive shock absorbers.
Take a typical car wheel of 70 lb. The mass is found
by dividing the weight by the earth’s gravitational accel-
eration (32.17 ft/s 2 ), resulting in m = 2.176 lb · s 2 /ft. The
curb weight of our car is 1985 lb, and the static displace-
ment of the spring is 4 inches (no passengers). The spring
constant is obtained by dividing the weight on each shock
absorber by the static displacement, so that we have
K = ( 14 )(1985)(3 ft −1 ) = 1489 lb/ft. We are also told that
the coefficient of friction for our piston-cylinder assem-
bly is 65 lb · s/ft. Thus, we can simulate our shock ab-
sorber by modeling it with a series RLC circuit having
R = 65 , L = 2.176 H, and C = K −1 = 671.6 μF.
The resonant frequency of our shock absorber is
ω 0 = (LC) −1/2 = 26.16 rad/s, and the damping coeffi-
cient is α = R/2L = 14.94 s −1 . Since α < ω 0 , our shock
absorber represents an underdamped system; this means
that we expect a bounce or two after we run over a pot-
hole. A stiffer shock (larger coefficient of friction, or a
larger resistance in our circuit model) is typically desir-
able when curves are taken at high speeds—at some
point this corresponds to an overdamped response. How-
ever, if most of our driving is over unpaved roads, a
slightly underdamped response is preferable.359

9.7 THE LOSSLESS LC CIRCUIT
•
When we considered the source-free RLC circuit, it became apparent that the
resistor served to dissipate any initial energy stored in the circuit. At some
point it might occur to us to ask what would happen if we could remove the
resistor. If the value of the resistance in a parallel RLC circuit becomes infinite,
or zero in the case of a series RLC circuit, we have a simple LC loop in which
an oscillatory response can be maintained forever. Let us look briefly at an ex-
ample of such a circuit, and then discuss another means of obtaining an iden-
tical response without the need of supplying any inductance.
Consider the source-free circuit of Fig. 9.34, in which the large values
1
L = 4 H and C = 36
F are used so that the calculations will be simple. We let
1
i(0) = − 6 A and v(0) = 0. We find that α = 0 and ω 0 2 = 9 s −2 , so that ω d =
3 rad/s. In the absence of exponential damping, the voltage v is simply
v = A cos 3t + B sin 3t
Since v(0) = 0, we see that A = 0. Next,
dv

But i(0) = − 16 ampere, and therefore dv/dt = 6 V/s at t = 0. We must have
B = 2 V and so
v = 2 sin 3t
V
which is an undamped sinusoidal response; in other words, our voltage
response does not decay.
Now let us see how we might obtain this voltage without using an LC cir-
cuit. Our intentions are to write the differential equation that v satisfies and
then to develop a configuration of op amps that will yield the solution of the
equation. Although we are working with a specific example, the technique is
a general one that can be used to solve any linear homogeneous differential
equation.
For the LC circuit of Fig. 9.34, we select v as our variable and set the sum

■ FIGURE 9.35 The inverting operational amplifier
provides a gain v o /v s = −R f /R 1 , assuming an ideal
op amp.
In order to solve this equation, we plan to make use of the operational amplifier
as an integrator. We assume that the highest-order derivative appearing in the
differential equation here, d 2 v/dt 2 , is available in our configuration of op
amps at an arbitrary point A. We now make use of the integrator, with RC = 1,
as discussed in Sec. 7.5. The input is d 2 v/dt 2 , and the output must be −dv/dt,
where the sign change results from using an inverting op amp configuration
for the integrator. The initial value of dv/dt is 6 V/s, as we showed when we
first analyzed the circuit, and thus an initial value of −6 V must be set in the in-
tegrator. The negative of the first derivative now forms the input to a second
integrator. Its output is therefore v(t), and the initial value is v(0) = 0. Now it
only remains to multiply v by −9 to obtain the second derivative we assumed
at point A. This is amplification by 9 with a sign change, and it is easily
accomplished by using the op amp as an inverting amplifier.
Figure 9.35 shows the circuit of an inverting amplifier. For an ideal op
amp, both the input current and the input voltage are zero. Thus, the current
going “east’’ through R 1 is v s /R 1 , while that traveling west through R f is
v o /R f . Since their sum is zero, we have
R f
v o
=−
v s
R 1
Thus, we can design for a gain of −9 by setting R f = 90 k and R 1 = 10 k ,
for example.
If we let R be 1 M and C be 1 μF in each of the integrators, then
t
v o = −
v s dt + v o (0)

in each case. The output of the inverting amplifier now forms the assumed in-
put at point A, leading to the configuration of op amps shown in Fig. 9.36. If
the left switch is closed at t = 0 while the two initial-condition switches are
opened at the same time, the output of the second integrator will be the un-
damped sine wave v = 2 sin 3t V.
Note that both the LC circuit of Fig. 9.34 and the op amp circuit
of Fig. 9.36 have the same output, but the op amp circuit does not contain a

the appropriate sinusoidal voltage between its output terminal and ground.
This can be a considerable practical or economic advantage in circuit design,
as inductors are typically bulky, more costly than capacitors, and have more
losses associated with them (and therefore are not as well approximated by
the “ideal’’ model).

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
The simple RL and RC circuits examined in Chap. 8 essentially did one of
two things as the result of throwing a switch: charge or discharge. Which
one happened was determined by the initial charge state of the energy
storage element. In this chapter, we considered circuits that had two energy
storage elements (a capacitor and an inductor), and found that things could
get pretty interesting. There are two basic configurations of such RLC
circuits: parallel connected and series connected. Analysis of such a circuit
yields a second-order partial differential equation, consistent with the
number of distinct energy storage elements (if we construct a circuit using
only resistors and capacitors such that the capacitors cannot be combined
using series/parallel techniques, we also obtain—eventually—a second-
order partial differential equation).
Depending on the value of the resistance connected to our energy
storage elements, we found the transient response of an RLC circuit could
be either overdamped (decaying exponentially) or underdamped (decaying,
but oscillatory), with a “special case” of critically damped which is difficult
to achieve in practice. Oscillations can be useful (for example, in
transmitting information over a wireless network) and not so useful (for
example, in accidental feedback situations between an amplifier and a
microphone at a concert). Although the oscillations are not sustained in the
circuits we examined, we have at least seen one way to create them at will,

CHAPTER 9 THE RLC CIRCUIT
and design for a specific frequency of operation if so desired. We didn’t end
up spending a great deal of time with the series connected RLC circuit
because with the exception of α, the equations are the same; only a minor
adjustment in how we employ initial conditions to find the two unknown
constants characterizing the transient response is needed. Along those lines,
there were two “tricks,” if you will, that we encountered. One is that to
employ the second initial condition, we need to take the derivative of our
response equation. The second is that whether we’re employing KCL or
KVL to make use of that initial condition, we’re doing so at the instant that
t = 0; appreciating this fact can simplify equations dramatically by setting
t = 0 early.
We wrapped up the chapter by considering the complete response, and
our approach to this did not differ significantly from what we did in Chap. 8.
We closed with a brief section on a topic that might have occurred to us at
some point—what happens when we remove the resistive losses completely
(by setting parallel resistance to ∞, or series resistance to 0)? We end up
with an LC circuit, and we saw that we can approximate such an animal
with an op amp circuit.
By now the reader is likely ready to finish reviewing key concepts of the
chapter, so we’ll stop here and list them, along with corresponding exam-
ples in the text.

Circuits that contain two energy storage devices that cannot be com-
bined using series-parallel combination techniques are described by a
second-order differential equation.
Series and parallel RLC circuits fall into one of three categories, depend-
ing on the relative values of R, L, and C:
Overdamped
Critically damped
Underdamped
❑
❑
❑
❑
α > ω 0
α = ω 0
α < ω 0
(Example 9.1)
√
For series RLC circuits, α = R/2L and ω 0 = 1/ LC. (Example 9.7)
√
For parallel RLC circuits, α = 1/2RC and ω 0 = 1/ LC. (Example 9.1)
The typical form of an overdamped response is the sum of two exponen-
tial terms, one of which decays more quickly than the other: e.g.,
A 1 e −t + A 2 e −6t . (Examples 9.2, 9.3, 9.4)
The typical form of a critically damped response is e −αt (A 1 t + A 2 ).
(Example 9.5)
❑ The typical form of an underdamped response is an exponentially
damped sinusoid: e −αt (B 1 cos ω d t + B 2 sin ω d t).
(Examples 9.6, 9.7, 9.8)
❑ During the transient response of an RLC circuit, energy is transferred
between energy storage elements to the extent allowed by the resistive
component of the circuit, which acts to dissipate the energy initially
stored. (See Computer-Aided Analysis section.)
The complete response is the sum of the forced and natural responses.
In this case the total response must be determined before solving for the
constants. (Examples 9.9, 9.10)

INTRODUCTION
The complete response of a linear electric circuit is composed of
two parts, the natural response and the forced response. The
natural response is the short-lived transient response of a circuit to
a sudden change in its condition. The forced response is the long-
term steady-state response of a circuit to any independent sources
present. Up to this point, the only forced response we have consid-
ered is that due to dc sources. Another very common forcing
function is the sinusoidal waveform. This function describes the
voltage available at household electrical sockets as well as the volt-
age of power lines connected to residential and industrial areas.
In this chapter, we assume that the transient response is of little
interest, and the steady-state response of a circuit (a television set,
a toaster, or a power distribution network) to a sinusoidal voltage
or current is needed. We will analyze such circuits using a
powerful technique that transforms integrodifferential equations
into algebraic equations. Before we see how that works, it’s useful
to quickly review a few important attributes of general sinusoids,
which will describe pretty much all currents and voltages through-
out the chapter.

Consider a sinusoidally varying voltage
v(t) = V m sin ωt
shown graphically in Figs. 10.1a and b. The amplitude of the sine
wave is V m , and the argument is ωt. The radian frequency, or angular
frequency, is ω. In Fig. 10.1a, V m sin ωt is plotted as a function of
the argument ωt, and the periodic nature of the sine wave is evident.

■ FIGURE 10.1 The sinusoidal function v(t) = V m sin ωt is plotted (a) versus ωt and (b) versus t.
The function repeats itself every 2π radians, and its period is therefore 2π
radians. In Fig. 10.1b, V m sin ωt is plotted as a function of t and the period is
now T. A sine wave having a period T must execute 1/T periods each second;
its frequency f is 1/T hertz, abbreviated Hz. Thus,
f =

T
and since
ωT = 2π
we obtain the common relationship between frequency and radian frequency,
ω = 2π f
Lagging and Leading
A more general form of the sinusoid,
v(t) = V m sin(ωt + θ)
[1]
includes a phase angle θ in its argument. Equation [1] is plotted in Fig. 10.2
as a function of ωt, and the phase angle appears as the number of radians by
which the original sine wave (shown in green color in the sketch) is shifted
to the left, or earlier in time. Since corresponding points on the sinusoid
V m sin(ωt + θ) occur θ rad, or θ/ω seconds, earlier, we say that
V m sin(ωt + θ) leads V m sin ωt by θ rad. Therefore, it is correct to describe

sin ωt as lagging sin(ωt + θ) by θ rad, as leading sin(ωt + θ) by −θ rad,
or as leading sin(ωt − θ) by θ rad.
In either case, leading or lagging, we say that the sinusoids are out of
phase. If the phase angles are equal, the sinusoids are said to be in phase.
In electrical engineering, the phase angle is commonly given in degrees,
rather than radians; to avoid confusion we should be sure to always use the
degree symbol. Thus, instead of writing
v = 100 sin 2π1000t −
Recall that to convert radians to degrees, we simply
multiply the angle by 180/π.
π
6
we customarily use
v = 100 sin(2π1000t − 30 ◦ )
In evaluating this expression at a specific instant of time, e.g., t = 10 −4 s,
2π 1000t becomes 0.2π radian, and this should be expressed as 36° before
30° is subtracted from it. Don’t confuse your apples with your oranges.
Two sinusoidal waves whose phases are to be compared must:
1. Both be written as sine waves, or both as cosine waves.
2. Both be written with positive amplitudes.
3. Each have the same frequency.
Converting Sines to Cosines
The sine and cosine are essentially the same function, but with a 90° phase
difference. Thus, sin ωt = cos(ωt − 90 ◦ ). Multiples of 360° may be added
to or subtracted from the argument of any sinusoidal function without
changing the value of the function. Hence, we may say that
◦
v 1 = V m 1 cos(5t + 10 )
= V m 1 sin(5t + 90 ◦ + 10 ◦ )
= V m 1 sin(5t + 100 ◦ )
Note that:
−sin ωt = sin(ωt ± 180 ◦ )
−cos ωt = cos(ωt ± 180 ◦ )
∓sin ωt = cos(ωt ± 90 ◦ )
±cos ωt = sin(ωt ± 90 ◦ )
v 1
leads
v 2 = V m 2 sin(5t − 30 ◦ )

by 130°. It is also correct to say that v 1 lags v 2 by 230°, since v 1 may be
written as
v 1 = V m 1 sin(5t − 260 ◦ )
We assume that V m 1 and V m 2 are both positive quantities. A graphical
representation is provided in Fig. 10.3; note that the frequency of both sinu-
soids (5 rad/s in this case) must be the same, or the comparison is meaning-
less. Normally, the difference in phase between two sinusoids is expressed
by that angle which is less than or equal to 180° in magnitude.
The concept of a leading or lagging relationship between two sinusoids
will be used extensively, and the relationship is recognizable both mathe-
matically and graphically.

FORCED RESPONSE TO SINUSOIDAL
• FUNCTIONS
Now that we are familiar with the mathematical characteristics of sinusoids,
we are ready to apply a sinusoidal forcing function to a simple circuit and
obtain the forced response. We will first write the differential equation that
applies to the given circuit. The complete solution of this equation is com-
posed of two parts, the complementary solution (which we call the natural
response) and the particular integral (or forced response). The methods we
plan to develop in this chapter assume that we are not interested in the short-
lived transient or natural response of our circuit, but only in the long-term
or “steady-state” response.

L
The term steady-state response is used synonymously with forced response,
and the circuits we are about to analyze are commonly said to be in the
“sinusoidal steady state.” Unfortunately, steady state carries the connota-
tion of “not changing with time” in the minds of many students. This is true
for dc forcing functions, but the sinusoidal steady-state response is defi-
nitely changing with time. The steady state simply refers to the condition
that is reached after the transient or natural response has died out.
The forced response has the mathematical form of the forcing function,
plus all its derivatives and its first integral. With this knowledge, one of the
methods by which the forced response may be found is to assume a solution
composed of a sum of such functions, where each function has an unknown
amplitude to be determined by direct substitution in the differential equa-
tion. As we are about to see, this can be a lengthy process, so we will be
sufficiently motivated to seek out a simpler alternative.
Consider the series RL circuit shown in Fig. 10.4. The sinusoidal source
voltage v s = V m cos ωt has been switched into the circuit at some remote
time in the past, and the natural response has died out completely. We seek
the forced (or “steady-state”) response, which must satisfy the differential
equation
L
di
+ Ri = V m cos ωt
dt
obtained by applying KVL around the simple loop. At any instant where the
derivative is equal to zero, we see that the current must have the form
i ∝ cos ωt . Similarly, at an instant where the current is equal to zero, the375
SECTION 10.2 FORCED RESPONSE TO SINUSOIDAL FUNCTIONS
derivative must be proportional to cos ωt, implying a current of the form
sin ωt . We might expect, therefore, that the forced response will have the
general form
i(t) = I 1 cos ωt + I 2 sin ωt
where I 1 and I 2 are real constants whose values depend upon V m , R, L, and ω.
No constant or exponential function can be present. Substituting the assumed
form for the solution in the differential equation yields
L(−I 1 ω sin ωt + I 2 ω cos ωt) + R(I 1 cos ωt + I 2 sin ωt) = V m cos ωt
If we collect the cosine and sine terms, we obtain
(−L I 1 ω + R I 2 ) sin ωt + (L I 2 ω + R I 1 − V m ) cos ωt = 0
This equation must be true for all values of t, which can be achieved
only if the factors multiplying cos ωt and sin ωt are each zero. Thus,
−ωL I 1 + R I 2 = 0
ωL I 2 + R I 1 − V m = 0
and
and simultaneous solution for I 1 and I 2 leads to
I 1 =
RV m
R 2 + ω 2 L 2
I 2 =
ωL V m
R 2 + ω 2 L 2
Thus, the forced response is obtained:
i(t) =
RV m
ωL V m
cos ωt + 2
sin ωt
R 2 + ω 2 L 2
R + ω 2 L 2
[2]
A More Compact and User-Friendly Form
Although accurate, this expression is slightly cumbersome; a clearer picture
of the response can be obtained by expressing it as a single sinusoid or
cosinusoid with a phase angle. We choose to express the response as a cosine
function,
i(t) = A cos(ωt − θ)
[3]
At least two methods of obtaining the values of A and θ suggest them-
selves. We might substitute Eq. [3] directly in the original differential
equation, or we could simply equate the two solutions, Eqs. [2] and [3].
Selecting the latter method, and expanding the function cos(ωt − θ):
A cos θ cos ωt + A sin θ sin ωt =
R 2
RV m
ωL V m
cos ωt + 2

All that remains is to collect terms and perform a bit of algebra, an exercise
left to the reader. The result is

θ = tan −1

and
V m
A = √
R 2 + ω 2 L 2
and so the alternative form of the forced response therefore becomes

[4]
Several useful trigonometric identities are provided
on the inside cover of the book.376
Once upon a time, the symbol E (for electromotive
force) was used to designate voltages. Then every stu-
dent learned the phase “ELI the ICE man” as a reminder
that voltage leads current in an inductive circuit, while
current leads voltage in a capacitive circuit. Now that
we use V instead, it just isn’t the same.
CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS
With this form, it is easy to see that the amplitude of the response is
proportional to the amplitude of the forcing function; if not, the linearity
concept would have to be discarded. The current is seen to lag the applied
voltage by tan −1 (ωL/R), an angle between 0 and 90°. When ω = 0 or
L = 0, the current must be in phase with the voltage; since the former situ-
ation is direct current and the latter provides a resistive circuit, the result
agrees with our previous experience. If R = 0, the current lags the voltage
by 90°. In an inductor, then, if the passive sign convention is satisfied, the
current lags the voltage by exactly 90°. In a similar manner we can show
that the current through a capacitor leads the voltage across it by 90°.
The phase difference between the current and voltage depends upon the
ratio of the quantity ωL to R. We call ωL the inductive reactance of the in-
ductor; it is measured in ohms, and it is a measure of the opposition that is
offered by the inductor to the passage of a sinusoidal current.

THE COMPLEX FORCING FUNCTION
The method we just employed works—the correct answer is obtained in a
straightforward manner. However, it isn’t particularly graceful, and after
being applied to a few circuits, it remains as clunky and cumbersome as the
first time we use it. The real problem isn’t the time-varying source—it’s the
inductor (or capacitor), since a purely resistive circuit is no more difficult to
analyze with sinusoidal sources than with dc sources, as only algebraic
equations result. It turns out that if the transient response is of no interest to
us, there is an alternative approach for obtaining the sinusoidal steady-state
response of any linear circuit. The distinct advantage of this alternative is
that it allows us to relate the current and voltage associated with any element
using a simple algebraic expression.
The basic idea is that sinusoids and exponentials are related through
complex numbers. Euler’s identity, for example, tells us that
e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ
Whereas taking the derivative of a cosine function yields a (negative) sine
function, the derivative of an exponential is simply a scaled version of the
same exponential. If at this point the reader is thinking, “All this is great, but
there are no imaginary numbers in any circuit I ever plan to build!” that may
be true. What we’re about to see, however, is that adding imaginary sources
to our circuits leads to complex sources which (surprisingly) simplify the
analysis process. It might seem like a strange idea at first, but a moment’s
reflection should remind us that superposition requires any imaginary sources
we might add to cause only imaginary responses, and real sources can only
lead to real responses. Thus, at any point, we should be able to separate the
two by simply taking the real part of any complex voltage or current.
In Fig. 10.8, a sinusoidal source
V m cos(ωt + θ)
[5]
is connected to a general network, which we will assume to contain only
passive elements (i.e., no independent sources) in order to keep things
simple. A current response in some other branch of the network is to be
determined, and the parameters appearing in Eq. [5] are all real quantities.

produces the steady-state sinusoidal response I m cos(ωt + φ).
We have shown that we may represent the response by the general co-
sine function
I m cos(ωt + φ)
[6]
A sinusoidal forcing function always produces a sinusoidal forced response
of the same frequency in a linear circuit.379
SECTION 10.3 THE COMPLEX FORCING FUNCTION
Now let us change our time reference by shifting the phase of the forc-
ing function by 90°, or changing the instant that we call t = 0. Thus, the
forcing function
V m cos(ωt + θ − 90 ◦ ) = V m sin(ωt + θ)
[7]
when applied to the same network will produce a corresponding response
I m cos(ωt + φ − 90 ◦ ) = I m sin(ωt + φ)
[8]
We next depart from physical reality by applying an imaginary forcing
function, one that cannot be applied in the laboratory but can be applied
mathematically.
Imaginary Sources Lead to . . . Imaginary Responses
We construct an imaginary source very simply; it is only necessary to mul-
tiply Eq. [7] by j, the imaginary operator. We thus apply
jV m sin(ωt + θ)
[9]
What is the response? If we had doubled the source, then the principle of
linearity would require that we double the response; multiplication of the
forcing function by a constant k would result in the multiplication
of the
√
response by the same constant k. The fact that our constant is −1 does not
destroy this relationship. The response to the imaginary source of Eq. [9] is
thus
jI m sin(ωt + φ)
[10]
The imaginary source and response are indicated in Fig. 10.9.

the imaginary sinusoidal response jI m sin(ωt + φ) in the network of Fig. 10.8.
Applying a Complex Forcing Function
We have applied a real source and obtained a real response; we have also
applied an imaginary source and obtained an imaginary response. Since we
are dealing with a linear circuit, we may use the superposition theorem to
find the response to a complex forcing function which is the sum of the real
and imaginary forcing functions. Thus, the sum of the forcing functions of
Eqs. [5] and [9],
V m cos(ωt + θ) + jV m sin(ωt + θ)
[11]
must produce a response that is the sum of Eqs. [6] and [10],
I m cos(ωt + φ) + jI m sin(ωt + φ)
[12]
Electrical engineers use “j ” instead of “i” to represent
√
−1 to avoid confusion with currents.380
CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS
The complex source and response may be represented more simply by ap-
plying Euler’s identity, i.e., cos(ωt + θ) + j sin(ωt + θ) = e j (ωt+θ) . Thus,
the source of Eq. [11] may be written as
V m e j (ωt+θ) [13]
I m e j (ωt+φ) [14]
and the response of Eq. [12] is
The complex source and response are illustrated in Fig. 10.10.

■ FIGURE 10.10 The complex forcing function V m e j (ωt +θ)
produces the complex response I m e j (ωt +θ) in the network
of Fig. 10.8.
Again, linearity assures us that the real part of the complex response is
produced by the real part of the complex forcing function, while the imagi-
nary part of the response is caused by the imaginary part of the complex
forcing function. Our plan is that instead of applying a real forcing function
to obtain the desired real response, we will substitute a complex forcing
function whose real part is the given real forcing function; we expect to
obtain a complex response whose real part is the desired real response. The
advantage of this procedure is that the integrodifferential equations describ-
ing the steady-state response of a circuit will now become simple algebraic
equations.
An Algebraic Alternative to Differential Equations
Let’s try out this idea on the simple RL series circuit shown in Fig. 10.11.
The real source V m cos ωt is applied; the real response i(t) is desired. Since
V m cos ωt = Re{V m cos ωt + j V m sin ωt} = Re{V m e jωt }
the necessary complex source is
V m e jωt

We express the complex response that results in terms of an unknown
amplitude I m and an unknown phase angle φ:

Writing the differential equation for this particular circuit,
■ FIGURE 10.11 A simple circuit in the sinusoidal

we insert our complex expressions for v s and i:

take the indicated derivative:
R I m e j (ωt+φ) + jωL I m e j (ωt+φ) = V m e jωt
and obtain an algebraic equation. In order to determine the values of I m and
φ, we divide throughout by the common factor e jωt :
R I m e jφ + jωL I m e jφ = V m
factor the left side:
I m e jφ (R + jωL) = V m
rearrange:
I m e jφ =

and identify I m and φ by expressing the right side of the equation in expo-
nential or polar form:

tified, we can write the expression for i(t) immediately. However, if we feel
like using a more rigorous approach, we may obtain the real response i(t)
by reinserting the e jωt factor on both sides of Eq. [15] and taking the real
part. Either way, we find that

SECTION 10.4 THE PHASOR
10.4
•
THE PHASOR
In the last section, we saw that the addition of an imaginary sinusoidal source
led to algebraic equations which describe the sinusoidal steady-state re-
sponse of a circuit. An intermediate step of our analysis was the “canceling”
of the complex exponential term—once its derivative was taken, we appar-
ently had no further use for it until the real form of the response was desired.
Even then, it was possible to read the magnitude and phase angle directly
from our analysis, and hence skip the step where we overtly take the real
part. Another way of looking at this is that every voltage and current in our
circuit contain the same factor e jωt , and the frequency, although relevant to
our analysis, does not change as we move through the circuit. Dragging it
around, then, is a bit of a waste of time.
Looking back at Example 10.2, then, we could represent our source as
◦
3e j0 V
(or even just 3 V)
and our capacitor voltage as V m e jφ , which we ultimately found was
◦
0.02985e − j84.3 V. Knowledge of the source frequency is implicit here;
without it, we are unable to reconstruct any voltage or current.
These complex quantities are usually written in polar form rather than
exponential form in order to achieve a slight additional saving of time and
effort. For example, a source voltage
v(t) = V m cos ωt = V m cos(ωt + 0 ◦ )
we now represent in complex form as
V m /0 ◦
and its current response
i(t) = I m cos(ωt + φ)
becomes
I m φ
This abbreviated complex representation is called a phasor. 1
Let us review the steps by which a real sinusoidal voltage or current is
transformed into a phasor, and then we will be able to define a phasor more
meaningfully and to assign a symbol to represent it.
A real sinusoidal current
i(t) = I m cos(ωt + φ)
is expressed as the real part of a complex quantity by invoking Euler’s
identity
i(t) = Re I m e j (ωt+φ)
We then represent the current as a complex quantity by dropping the in-
struction Re{}, thus adding an imaginary component to the current without
affecting the real component; further simplification is achieved by sup-
pressing the factor e jωt :
I = I m e jφ
and writing the result in polar form:
I = I m φ
(1) Not to be confused with the phaser, an interesting device featured in a popular television series. . . .
e j 0 = cos 0 + j sin 0 = 1
Remember that none of the steady-state circuits we are
considering will respond at a frequency other than that
of the excitation source, so that the value of ω is always
known.384
CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS
i(t) = I m cos (␻t + ␾)
i(t) = Re{I m e j(␻t + ␾) }
I = I m e j␾
This abbreviated complex representation is the phasor representation;
phasors are complex quantities and hence are printed in boldface type. Cap-
ital letters are used for the phasor representation of an electrical quantity
because the phasor is not an instantaneous function of time; it contains
only amplitude and phase information. We recognize this difference in view-
point by referring to i(t) as a time-domain representation and terming the
phasor I a frequency-domain representation. It should be noted that the
frequency-domain expression of a current or voltage does not explicitly in-
clude the frequency. The process of returning to the time domain from the
frequency domain is exactly the reverse of the previous sequence. Thus,
given the phasor voltage
I = I m ␾
The process by which we change i(t) into I is called a
phasor transformation from the time domain to the
frequency domain.
V = 115/−45 ◦ volts
and the knowledge that ω = 500 rad/s, we can write the time-domain
equivalent directly:
v(t) = 115 cos(500t − 45 ◦ )
volts
If desired as a sine wave, v(t) could also be written
v(t) = 115 sin(500t + 45 ◦ )

value of each of the currents given here in phasor form: (a) j10 A;
(b) 20 + j10 A; (c) 20 + j (10/20 ◦ ) A.
Ans: −9.09 A; −17.42 A; −15.44 A.
EXAMPLE 10.3
Transform the time-domain voltage v(t)
into the frequency domain.
100 cos(400t − 30°) volts
The time-domain expression is already in the form of a cosine wave
with a phase angle. Thus, suppressing ω = 400 rad/s,
V = 100/−30 ◦ volts
Note that we skipped several steps in writing this representation di-
rectly. Occasionally, this is a source of confusion for students, as they
may forget that the phasor representation is not equal to the time-domain
voltage v(t). Rather, it is a simplified form of a complex function
formed by adding an imaginary component to the real function v(t).

(c) 8 cos(4t − 30 ◦ ) + 4 sin(4t − 100 ◦ ). Hint: First convert each into
a single cosine function with a positive magnitude.
Ans: 5/−20 ◦ ; 2.41/−134.8 ◦ ; 4.46/−47.9 ◦ .385
SECTION 10.4 THE PHASOR
The real power of the phasor-based analysis technique lies in the fact
that it is possible to define algebraic relationships between the voltage and
current for inductors and capacitors, just as we have always been able to do
in the case of resistors. Now that we are able to transform into and out of the
frequency domain, we can proceed to our simplification of sinusoidal
steady-state analysis by establishing the relationship between the phasor
voltage and phasor current for each of the three passive elements.
The Resistor
The resistor provides the simplest case. In the time domain, as indicated by
Fig. 10.13a, the defining equation is i I
v(t) = Ri(t) + +
R
v = Ri
Now let us apply the complex voltage
v(t) = V m e j (ωt+θ) = V m cos(ωt + θ) + jV m sin(ωt + θ)
–
–
(a)
i(t) = I m e

and assume the complex current response

V = RI
[17]
(b)
■ FIGURE 10.13 A resistor and its associated voltage
and current in (a) the time domain, v = Ri; and
(b) the frequency domain, V = RI.
so that
V m e j (ωt+θ) = Ri(t) = R I m e j (ωt+φ)
Dividing throughout by e jωt , we find
V m e jθ = R I m e jφ
or, in polar form,
V m /θ = R I m φ
But V m /θ and I m φ merely represent the general voltage and current pha-
sors V and I. Thus,
V = RI
[18]
The voltage-current relationship in phasor form for a resistor has the
same form as the relationship between the time-domain voltage and cur-
rent. The defining equation in phasor form is illustrated in Fig. 10.13b. The
angles θ and φ are equal, so that the current and voltage are always
in phase.
As an example of the use of both the time-domain and frequency-
domain relationships, let us assume that a voltage of 8 cos(100t − 50 ◦ ) V is
across a 4 resistor. Working in the time domain, we find that the current
must be
i(t) =
v(t)
= 2 cos(100t − 50 ◦ )
R
A
The phasor form of the same voltage is 8/−50 ◦ V, and therefore
I =
V
= 2/−50 ◦
R
A
Ohm’s law holds true both in the time domain and
in the frequency domain. In other words, the voltage
across a resistor is always given by the resistance times
the current flowing through the element.386
CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS
If we transform this answer back to the time domain, it is evident that the
same expression for the current is obtained. We conclude that there is no
saving in time or effort when a resistive circuit is analyzed in the frequency
domain.

Taking the indicated derivative:

and dividing through by e jωt :
V m e jθ = jωL I m e jφ
we obtain the desired phasor relationship
V = jωLI
[20]
The time-domain differential equation [19] has become the algebraic
equation [20] in the frequency domain. The phasor relationship is indicated
in Fig. 10.14b. Note that the angle of the factor jωL is exactly +90 ◦ and
that I must therefore lag V by 90° in an inductor.
EXAMPLE 10.4
Apply the voltage 8/−50° V at a frequency ω 100 rad/s to a 4 H
inductor, and determine the phasor current and the time-domain
current.

The equivalent expression in the frequency domain is obtained once more
by letting v(t) and i(t) be the complex quantities of Eqs. [16] and [17], tak-
ing the indicated derivative, suppressing e jωt , and recognizing the phasors V
and I. Doing this, we find

Thus, I leads V by 90° in a capacitor. This, of course, does not mean that a
current response is present one-quarter of a period earlier than the voltage
that caused it! We are studying steady-state response, and we find that the
current maximum is caused by the increasing voltage that occurs 90° earlier
than the voltage maximum.
The time-domain and frequency-domain representations are compared
in Fig. 10.15a and b. We have now obtained the V-I relationships for the
three passive elements. These results are summarized in Table 10.1, where
the time-domain v-i expressions and the frequency-domain V-I relation-
ships are shown in adjacent columns for the three circuit elements. All the
phasor equations are algebraic. Each is also linear, and the equations relat-
ing to inductance and capacitance bear a great similarity to Ohm’s law. In
fact, we will indeed use them as we use Ohm’s law.

Kirchhoff’s Laws Using Phasors
Kirchhoff’s voltage law in the time domain is
v 1 (t) + v 2 (t) + · · · + v N (t) = 0
We now use Euler’s identity to replace each real voltage v i by a complex
voltage having the same real part, suppress e jωt throughout, and obtain
V 1 + V 2 + · · · + V N = 0
Thus, we see that Kirchhoff’s voltage law applies to phasor voltages just as
it did in the time domain. Kirchhoff’s current law can be shown to hold for
phasor currents by a similar argument.

For the RLC circuit of Fig. 10.17, determine I s and i s (t) if both
sources operate at ω = 2 rad/s, and I C = 2 28 A.
The fact that we are given I C and asked for I s is all the prompting we
need to consider applying KCL. If we label the capacitor voltage V C

we find that these ratios are simple quantities that depend on element values
(and frequency also, in the case of inductance and capacitance). We treat
these ratios in the same manner that we treat resistances, provided we
remember that they are complex quantities.
Let us define the ratio of the phasor voltage to the phasor current as
impedance, symbolized by the letter Z. The impedance is a complex quan-
tity having the dimensions of ohms. Impedance is not a phasor and cannot
be transformed to the time domain by multiplying by e jωt and taking the real
part. Instead, we think of an inductor as being represented in the time
domain by its inductance L and in the frequency domain by its impedance
jωL. A capacitor in the time domain has a capacitance C; in the frequency
domain, it has an impedance 1/jωC . Impedance is a part of the frequency
domain and not a concept that is a part of the time domain.

Series Impedance Combinations
The validity of Kirchhoff’s two laws in the frequency domain leads to the fact
that impedances may be combined in series and parallel by the same rules we
established for resistances. For example, at ω = 10 × 10 3 rad/s, a 5 mH
inductor in series with a 100 μF capacitor may be replaced by the sum of the
individual impedances. The impedance of the inductor is
Z L = jωL = j50
and the impedance of the capacitor is
Z C =
1
− j
=
= − j1
jωC
ωC
The impedance of the series combination is therefore
Z eq = Z L + Z C = j50 − j1 = j49
The impedance of inductors and capacitors is a function of frequency,
and this equivalent impedance is thus applicable only at the single frequency
at which it was calculated, ω = 10,000 rad/s. If we change the frequency to
ω = 5000 rad/s, for example, Z eq = j23 .
Parallel Impedance Combinations
The parallel combination of the 5 mH inductor and the 100 μF capacitor at
ω = 10,000 rad/s is calculated in exactly the same fashion in which we

At ω = 5000 rad/s, the parallel equivalent is − j2.17

Reactance
Of course, we may choose to express impedance in either rectangular
(Z = R + jX) or polar (Z = |Z|/θ ) form. In rectangular form, we can see
clearly the real part which arises only from real resistances, and an imagi-
nary component, termed the reactance, which arises from the energy
storage elements. Both resistance and reactance have units of ohms, but
reactance will always depend upon frequency. An ideal resistor has zero
reactance; an ideal inductor or capacitor is purely reactive (i.e., character-
ized by zero resistance). Can a series or parallel combination include both
a capacitor and an inductor, and yet have zero reactance? Sure! Consider
the series connection of a 1 resistor, a 1 F capacitor, and a 1 H inductor
driven at ω = 1 rad/s. Z eq = 1 − j (1)(1) + j (1)(1) = 1 . At that partic-
ular frequency, the equivalent is a simple 1 resistor. However, even small
deviations from ω = 1 rad/s lead to nonzero reactance.

It is important to note that the resistive component of the impedance is not
necessarily equal to the resistance of the resistor that is present in the net-
work. For example, a 10 resistor and a 5 H inductor in series at ω = 4 rad/s
have an equivalent impedance Z = 10 + j20 , or, in polar form,
22.4/63.4 ◦ . In this case, the resistive component of the impedance is equal
to the resistance of the series resistor because the network is a simple series
network. However, if these same two elements are placed in parallel, the
equivalent impedance is 10( j20)/(10 + j20) , or 8 + j4 . The resistive
component of the impedance is now 8 .

᭤ Identify the goal of the problem.
We need to find the sinusoidal steady-state current flowing through the
1.5 k resistor due to the 3000 rad/s voltage source.
᭤ Collect the known information.
We begin by drawing a frequency-domain circuit. The source is trans-
formed to the frequency-domain representation 40/−90 ◦ V, the fre-
quency domain response is represented as I, and the impedances of
the inductor and capacitor, determined at ω = 3000 rad/s, are j k and
− j2 k , respectively. The corresponding frequency-domain circuit is
shown in Fig. 10.20b.
᭤ Devise a plan.
We will analyze the circuit of Fig. 10.20b to obtain I; combining im-
pedances and invoking Ohm’s law is one possible approach. We will
then make use of the fact that we know ω = 3000 rad/s to convert I
into a time-domain expression.
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.

᭤ Determine if additional information is required.
Substituting known values, we find that
I =

2.5/36.87 ◦
which, along with the knowledge that ω = 3000 rad/s, is sufficient to
solve for i(t).

This complex expression is easily simplified to a single complex
number in polar form:
I =

Upon transforming the current to the time domain, the desired
response is obtained:
i(t) = 16 cos(3000t − 126.9 ◦ )
mA
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
The effective impedance connected to the source has an angle of
+36.87°, indicating that it has a net inductive character, or that the
current will lag the voltage. Since the voltage source has a phase
angle of −90 ◦ (once converted to a cosine source), we see that our
answer is consistent.

Before we begin to write great numbers of equations in the time domain
or in the frequency domain, it is very important that we shun the construc-
tion of equations that are partly in the time domain, partly in the frequency
domain, and wholly incorrect. One clue that a faux pas of this type has been
committed is the sight of both a complex number and a t in the same equa-
tion, except in the factor e jωt . And, since e jωt plays a much bigger role in
derivations than in applications, it is pretty safe to say that students who find
they have just created an equation containing j and t, or / and t, have cre-
ated a monster that the world would be better off without.

There is a general (unitless) term for both impedance
and admittance—immitance—which is sometimes
used, but not very often.
Although the concept of impedance is very useful, and familiar in a way
based on our experience with resistors, the reciprocal is often just as valu-
able. We define this quantity as the admittance Y of a circuit element or
passive network, and it is simply the ratio of current to voltage:
The real part of the admittance is the conductance G, and the imaginary
part is the susceptance B. All three quantities (Y, G, and B) are measured
in siemens.
The real part of the admittance is the conductance G, and the imaginary
part of the admittance is the susceptance B. Thus,
Y = G + jB =

Equation [22] should be scrutinized carefully; it does not state that the
real part of the admittance is equal to the reciprocal of the real part of the
impedance, or that the imaginary part of the admittance is equal to the reci-
procal of the imaginary part of the impedance!

NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS
We previously achieved a great deal with nodal and mesh analysis techniques,
and it’s reasonable to ask if a similar procedure might be valid in terms of pha-
sors and impedances for the sinusoidal steady state. We already know that
both of Kirchhoff’s laws are valid for phasors; also, we have an Ohm-like law
for the passive elements V = ZI. We may therefore analyze circuits by nodal
techniques in the sinusoidal steady state. Using similar arguments, we can
establish that mesh analysis methods are valid (and often useful) as well.SECTION 10.6 NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS

SUPERPOSITION, SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS,
• AND THÉVENIN’S THEOREM
After inductors and capacitors were introduced in Chap. 7, we found that
circuits containing these elements were still linear, and that the benefits of
linearity were again available. Included among these were the superposition
principle, Thévenin’s and Norton’s theorems, and source transformations.
Thus, we know that these methods may be used on the circuits we are now
considering; the fact that we happen to be applying sinusoidal sources and
are seeking only the forced response is immaterial. The fact that we are an-
alyzing the circuits in terms of phasors is also immaterial; they are still lin-
ear circuits. We might also remember that linearity and superposition were
invoked when we combined real and imaginary sources to obtain a complex
source.

–PRACTICAL APPLICATION
Cutoff Frequency of a Transistor Amplifier
Transistor-based amplifier circuits are an integral part
of many modern electronic instruments. One common
application is in mobile telephones (Fig. 10.26), where
audio signals are superimposed on high-frequency car-
rier waves. Unfortunately, transistors have built-in capac-
itances that lead to limitations in the frequencies at
which they can be used, and this fact must be considered
when choosing a transistor for a particular application.
Figure 10.27a shows what is commonly referred to
as a high-frequency hybrid-π model for a bipolar junc-
tion transistor. In practice, although transistors are non-
linear devices, we find that this simple linear circuit
does a reasonably accurate job of modeling the actual
device behavior. The two capacitors C π and C μ are used
to represent internal capacitances that characterize the
particular transistor being used; additional capacitors as
well as resistors can be added to increase the accuracy of
the model as needed. Figure 10.27b shows the transistor
model inserted into an amplifier circuit known as a com-
mon emitter amplifier.
Assuming a sinusoidal steady-state signal repre-
sented by its Thévenin equivalent V s and R s , we are in-
terested in the ratio of the output voltage V out to the input
voltage V in . The presence of the internal transistor ca-
pacitances leads to a reduction in amplification as the
frequency of V s is increased; this ultimately limits the
frequencies at which the circuit will operate properly.

One final comment is in order. Up to this point, we have restricted our-
selves to considering either single-source circuits or multiple-source circuits
in which every source operates at the exact same frequency. This is necessary
in order to define specific impedance values for inductive and capacitive
elements. However, the concept of phasor analysis can be easily extended to
circuits with multiple sources operating at different frequencies. In suchSolving for V out in terms of V in , and noting that V π =
V in , we obtain an expression for the amplifier gain
−g m (R C R L )(1/jωC μ ) + (R C R L )
V out
=
V in
(R C R L ) + (1/jωC μ )
=
−g m (R C R L ) + jω(R C R L )C μ
1 + jω(R C R L )C μ
Given the typical values g m = 30 mS, R C = R L = 2 k ,
and C μ = 5 pF, we can plot the magnitude of the gain as a
function of frequency (recalling that ω = 2πf ). The
semilogarithmic plot is shown in Fig. 10.28a, and the
MATLAB script used to generate the figure is given in
Fig. 10.28b. It is interesting, but maybe not totally sur-
prising, to see that a characteristic such as the amplifier
gain is dependent on frequency. In fact, we might be able
to contemplate using such a circuit as a means of filtering
out frequencies we aren’t interested in. However, at least
for relatively low frequencies, we see that the gain is
essentially independent of the frequency of our input
source.
When characterizing amplifiers, it is common to ref-
erence
√ the frequency at which the gain is reduced to
1/ 2 times its maximum value. From Fig. 10.28a, we
see that the maximum gain magnitude
√ is 30, and the
gain magnitude is reduced to 30/ 2 = 21 at a fre-
quency of approximately 30 MHz. This frequency is
often called the cutoff or corner frequency of the ampli-
fier. If operation at a higher frequency is required, either
the internal capacitances must be reduced (i.e., a differ-
ent transistor must be used) or the circuit must be re-
designed in some way.
We should note at this point that defining the gain
relative to V in does not present a complete picture of the
frequency-dependent behavior of the amplifier. This may
be apparent if we briefly consider the capacitance C π : as
ω → ∞, Z C π → 0, so V in → 0. This effect does not
manifest itself in the simple equation we derived. A more
comprehensive approach is to develop an equation for
V out in terms of V s , in which case both capacitances will
appear in the expression; this requires a little bit more
algebra.

instances, we simply employ superposition to determine the voltages and
currents due to each source, and then add the results in the time domain. If
several sources are operating at the same frequency, superposition will also
allow us to consider those sources at the same time, and add the resulting
response to the response(s) of any other source(s) operating at a different
frequency.

impedances is replaced by a single equivalent impedance. That is,
5 − j10 is 4 − j2 ; j10 − j5 is − j10 ; and 10 j5 is equal
to 2 + j4 . To find V 1 , we first activate only the left source and find

The open-circuit voltage, defined in Fig. 10.31b, is
V oc = (1/0 ◦ )(4 − j2) − (−0.5/−90 ◦ )(2 + j4)
= 4 − j2 + 2 − j1 = 6 − j3
V
The impedance of the inactive circuit of Fig. 10.31c as viewed from the
load terminals is simply the sum of the two remaining impedances.
Hence,
Z th = 6 + j2
Thus, when we reconnect the circuit as in Fig. 10.31d, the current di-
rected from node 1 toward node 2 through the − j 10 load is
6 − j3
I 12 =
= 0.6 + j0.3 A
6 + j2 − j10
We now know the current flowing through the − j 10 impedance
of Fig. 10.31a. Note that we are unable to compute V 1 using the circuit
of Fig. 10.31d as the reference node no longer exists. Returning to the
original circuit, then, and subtracting the 0.6 + j0.3 A current from the
left source current, the downward current through the (4 − j2)
branch is found:
I 1 = 1 − 0.6 − j0.3 = 0.4 − j0.3
A
and, thus,
V 1 = (0.4 − j0.3)(4 − j2) = 1 − j2
V
as before.
We might have been clever and used Norton’s theorem on the three
elements on the right of Fig. 10.31a, assuming that our chief interest is
in V 1 . Source transformations can also be used repeatedly to simplify
the circuit. Thus, all the shortcuts and tricks that arose in Chaps. 4 and
5 are available for circuit analysis in the frequency domain. The slight
additional complexity that is apparent now arises from the necessity of
using complex numbers and not from any more involved theoretical
considerations.

After glancing at the circuit, we might be tempted to write two quick
nodal equations, or perhaps perform two sets of source transformations
and launch immediately into finding the voltage across the 10 resistor.
Unfortunately, this is impossible, since we have two sources operat-
ing at different frequencies. In such a situation, there is no way to com-
pute the impedance of any capacitor or inductor in the circuit—which
ω would we use?
The only way out of this dilemma is to employ superposition, group-
ing all sources with the same frequency in the same subcircuit, as shown
in Fig. 10.33b and c.
In the subcircuit of Fig. 10.33b, we quickly compute the current I
using current division:
− j0.4
10 − j − j0.4
= 79.23/−82.03 ◦ mA
I = 2/0 ◦
(Continued on next page)
In future studies of signal processing, we will also be
introduced to the method of Jean-Baptiste Joseph
Fourier, a French mathematician who developed a
technique for representing almost any arbitrary function
by a combination of sinusoids. When working with lin-
ear circuits, once we know the response of a particular
circuit to a general sinusoidal forcing function, we can
easily predict the response of the circuit to an arbitrary
waveform represented by a Fourier series function,
simply by using superposition.404

Likewise, we find that

It should be noted at this point that no matter how tempted we might
be to add the two phasor currents I and I , in Fig. 10.33b and c, this
would be incorrect. Our next step is to add the two time-domain currents,
square the result, and multiply by 10 to obtain the power absorbed by the
10 resistor in Fig. 10.33a:

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
We have several options in PSpice for the analysis of circuits in the sinu-
soidal steady state. Perhaps the most straightforward approach is to make
use of two specially designed sources: VAC and IAC. The magnitude
and phase of either source is selected by double-clicking on the part.
Let’s simulate the circuit of Fig. 10.20a, shown redrawn in Fig. 10.35.
The frequency of the source is not selected through the Property
Editor, but rather through the ac sweep analysis dialog box. This is
accomplished by choosing AC Sweep/Noise for Analysis when pre-
sented with the Simulation Settings window. We select a Linear sweepSECTION 10.7 SUPERPOSITION, SOURCE TRANSFORMATIONS, AND THÉVENIN’S THEOREM

and set Total Points to 1. Since we are only interested in the frequency
of 3000 rad/s (477.5 Hz), we set both Start Frequency and End
Frequency to 477.5 as shown in Fig. 10.36.
■ FIGURE 10.36 Dialog box for setting source frequency.
Note that an additional “component’’ appears in the schematic. This
component is called IPRINT, and allows a variety of current parameters
to be printed. In this simulation, we are interested in the AC, MAG,
and PHASE attributes. In order for PSpice to print these quantities,
double-click on the IPRINT symbol in the schematic, and enter yes in
each of the appropriate fields.
The simulation results are obtained by choosing View Output File
under PSpice in the Capture CIS window.

PHASOR DIAGRAMS
The phasor diagram is a name given to a sketch in the complex plane show-
ing the relationships of the phasor voltages and phasor currents throughout
a specific circuit. We are already familiar with the use of the complex plane
in the graphical identification of complex numbers and in their addition and
subtraction. Since phasor voltages and currents are complex numbers, they
may also be identified as points in a complex plane. For example, the phasor
voltage V 1 = 6 + j8 = 10/53.1 ◦ V is identified on the complex voltage
plane shown in Fig. 10.37. The x axis is the real voltage axis, and the y axis is
the imaginary voltage axis; the voltage V 1 is located by an arrow drawn from
the origin. Since addition and subtraction are particularly easy to perform and
display on a complex plane, phasors may be easily added and subtracted in
a phasor diagram. Multiplication and division result in the addition and
subtraction of angles and a change of amplitude. Figure 10.38a shows the
sum of V 1 and a second phasor voltage V 2 = 3 − j4 = 5/−53.1 ◦ V, and
Fig. 10.38b shows the current I 1 , which is the product of V 1 and the admit-
tance Y = 1 + j1 S.
This last phasor diagram shows both current and voltage phasors on the
same complex plane; it is understood that each will have its own amplitude
scale, but a common angle scale. For example, a phasor voltage 1 cm long
might represent 100 V, while a phasor current 1 cm long could indicate 3 mA.
Plotting both phasors on the same diagram enables us to easily determine
which waveform is leading and which is lagging.
The phasor diagram also offers an interesting interpretation of the time-
domain to frequency-domain transformation, since the diagram may be in-
terpreted from either the time- or the frequency-domain viewpoint. Up to
this point, we have been using the frequency-domain interpretation, as we
have been showing phasors directly on the phasor diagram. However, let us
proceed to a time-domain viewpoint by first showing the phasor voltage
V = V m /α as sketched in Fig. 10.39a. In order to transform V to the time
domain, the next necessary step is the multiplication of the phasor by e jωt ;
thus we now have the complex voltage V m e jα e jωt = V m /ωt + α. This
voltage may also be interpreted as a phasor, one which possesses a phase
angle that increases linearly with time. On a phasor diagram it therefore
represents a rotating line segment, the instantaneous position being ωt radi-
ans ahead (counterclockwise) of V m /α. Both V m /α and V m /ωt + α are
shown on the phasor diagram of Fig. 10.39b. The passage to the time

SECTION 10.8 PHASOR DIAGRAMS
domain is now completed by taking the real part of V m /ωt + α. The real
part of this complex quantity is the projection of V m /ωt + α on the real
axis: V m cos(ωt + α).
In summary, then, the frequency-domain phasor appears on the phasor
diagram, and the transformation to the time domain is accomplished by al-
lowing the phasor to rotate in a counterclockwise direction at an angular ve-
locity of ω rad/s and then visualizing the projection on the real axis. It is
helpful to think of the arrow representing the phasor V on the phasor dia-
gram as the photographic snapshot, taken at ωt = 0, of a rotating arrow
whose projection on the real axis is the instantaneous voltage v(t).
Let us now construct the phasor diagrams for several simple circuits. The
series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 10.40a has several different voltages asso-
ciated with it, but only a single current. The phasor diagram is constructed
most easily by employing the single current as the reference phasor. Let us
arbitrarily select I = I m /0 ◦ and place it along the real axis of the phasor dia-
gram, Fig. 10.40b. The resistor, capacitor, and inductor voltages may then be
calculated and placed on the diagram, where the 90° phase relationships
stand out clearly. The sum of these three voltages is the source voltage, and
for this circuit, which is in what we will define in a subsequent chapter as
the “resonant condition’’ since Z C = −Z L , the source voltage and resistor
voltage are equal. The total voltage across the resistor and inductor or resis-
tor and capacitor is obtained from the diagram by adding the appropriate
phasors as shown.
Figure 10.41a is a simple parallel circuit in which it is logical to use the
single voltage between the two nodes as a reference phasor. Suppose that
V = 1/0 ◦ V. The resistor current, I R = 0.2/0 ◦ A, is in phase with this volt-
age, and the capacitor current, I C = j0.1 A, leads the reference voltage
by 90°. After these two currents are added to the phasor diagram, shown as
Fig. 10.41b, they may be summed to obtain the source current. The result is
I s = 0.2 + j0.1 A.

If the source current is specified initially as the convenient value of
1/0 ◦ A and the node voltage is not initially known, it is still convenient to
begin construction of the phasor diagram by assuming a node voltage (for
example, V = 1/0 ◦ V once again) and using it as the reference phasor. The
diagram is then completed as before, and the source current that flows as a
result of the assumed node voltage is again found to be 0.2 + j0.1 A. The
true source current is 1/0 ◦ A, however, and thus the true node voltage is
obtained by multiplying the assumed node voltage by 1/0 ◦ /(0.2 + j0.1);

the true node voltage is therefore 4 − j2 V = 20/−26.6 ◦ V. The as-
sumed voltage leads to a phasor diagram which differs from the true phasor
diagram

of 1/ 20) and an angular rotation (the assumed diagram is rotated coun-

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
This chapter dealt with the steady-state response of circuits to sinusoidal
excitation. This is a limited analysis of a circuit in some respects, as the
transient behavior is completely ignored. In many situations, such an
approach is more than adequate, and reducing the amount of information we
seek about a circuit speeds up the analysis considerably. The fundamental
idea behind what we did was that an imaginary source was added to every
real sinusoidal source; then Euler’s identity converted the source to a com-
plex exponential. Since the derivative of an exponential is simply another
exponential, what would otherwise be integrodifferential equations arising
from mesh or nodal analysis become algebraic equations.
A few new terms were introduced: lagging, leading, impedance, ad-
mittance, and a particularly important one phasor. Phasor relationships
between current and voltage gave rise to the concept of impedance, where
resistors are represented by a real number (resistance, as before), and
inductors are represented by Z = jωL while capacitors are represented
by − j/ωC(ω being the operating frequency of our sources). From that
point forward, all the circuit analysis techniques learned in Chaps. 3 to
5 apply.
It might seem odd to have an imaginary number as part of our solution,
but we found that recovering the time-domain solution to our analysis is
straightforward once the voltage or current is expressed in polar form. The
magnitude of our quantity of interest is the magnitude of the cosine func-
tion, the phase angle is the phase of the cosine term, and the frequency is
obtained from the original circuit (it disappears from view during the analy-
sis, but the circuits we are analyzing do not change it in any way). We con-
cluded the chapter with an introduction to the concept of phasor diagrams.
Prior to inexpensive scientific calculators such tools were invaluable in an-
alyzing many sinusoidal circuits. They still find use in analysis of ac power
systems, as we see in subsequent chapters.
A concise list of key concepts of the chapter is presented below for
the convenience of the reader, along with the corresponding example
numbers.
❑ If two sine waves (or two cosine waves) both have positive magnitudes
and the same frequency, it is possible to determine which waveform is
leading and which is lagging by comparing their phase angles.
❑ The forced response of a linear circuit to a sinusoidal voltage or current
source can always be written as a single sinusoid having the same
frequency as the sinusoidal source. (Example 10.1)
❑ A phasor has both a magnitude and a phase angle; the frequency is
understood to be that of the sinusoidal source driving the circuit.
(Example 10.2)
❑ A phasor transform may be performed on any sinusoidal function, and
vice versa: V m cos(ωt + φ) ↔ V m φ. (Example 10.3)
❑ When transforming a time-domain circuit into the corresponding
frequency-domain circuit, resistors, capacitors, and inductors are replaced
by impedances (or, occasionally, by admittances). (Examples 10.4, 10.6)
• The impedance of a resistor is simply its resistance.
409410
CHAPTER 10 SINUSOIDAL STEADY-STATE ANALYSIS
❑
❑
❑
❑
• The impedance of a capacitor is 1/jωC .
• The impedance of an inductor is jωL .
Impedances combine both in series and in parallel combinations in the
same manner as resistors. (Example 10.6)
All analysis techniques previously used on resistive circuits apply to
circuits with capacitors and/or inductors once all elements are replaced
by their frequency-domain equivalents. (Examples 10.5, 10.7, 10.8,
10.9, 10.10, 10.11)
Phasor analysis can only be performed on single-frequency circuits.
Otherwise, superposition must be invoked, and the time-domain partial
responses added to obtain the complete response. (Example 10.12)
The power behind phasor diagrams is evident when a convenient forcing
function is used initially, and the final result scaled appropriately.

AC Circuit Power

Analysis
KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
Often an integral part of circuit analysis is the determination of
either power delivered or power absorbed (or both). In the context
of ac power, we find that the rather simple approach we have taken
previously does not provide a convenient picture of how a particu-
lar system is operating, so we introduce several different power-
related quantities in this chapter.
We begin by considering instantaneous power, the product of
the time-domain voltage and time-domain current associated with
the element or network of interest. The instantaneous power
is sometimes quite useful in its own right, because its maximum
value might have to be limited to avoid exceeding the safe
operating range of a physical device. For example, transistor and
vacuum-tube power amplifiers both produce a distorted output,
and speakers give a distorted sound, when the peak power exceeds
a certain limiting value. However, we are mainly interested in
instantaneous power for the simple reason that it provides us with
the means to calculate a more important quantity, the average
power. In a similar way, the progress of a cross-country road trip
is best described by the average velocity; our interest in the instan-
taneous velocity is limited to the avoidance of maximum velocities
that will endanger our safety or arouse the highway patrol.
In practical problems we will deal with values of average
power which range from the small fraction of a picowatt available
in a telemetry signal from outer space, to the few watts of audio
power supplied to the speakers in a good stereo system, to the sev-
eral hundred watts required to run the morning coffeepot, or to the
10 billion watts generated at the Grand Coulee Dam. Still, we will

see that even the concept of average power has its limitations, especially
when dealing with the energy exchange between reactive loads and power
sources. This is easily handled by introducing the concepts of reactive
power, complex power, and the power factor—all very common terms in
the power industry.

INSTANTANEOUS POWER
The instantaneous power delivered to any device is given by the product
of the instantaneous voltage across the device and the instantaneous current
through it (the passive sign convention is assumed). Thus, 1
p(t) = v(t)i(t)
[1]
If the device in question is a resistor of resistance R, then the power may be
expressed solely in terms of either the current or the voltage:
p(t) = v(t)i(t) = i 2 (t)R =
v 2 (t)
R
[2]
If the voltage and current are associated with a device that is entirely induc-
tive, then

(1) Earlier, we agreed that lowercase variables in italics were understood to be functions of time, and we
have carried on in this spirit up to now. However, in order to emphasize the fact that these quantities must
be evaluated at a specific instant in time, we will explicitly denote the time dependence throughout this

Only a few algebraic manipulations are required to show that
p(t) = p R (t) + p L (t)
which serves to check the accuracy of our work; the results are sketched in
Fig. 11.2.
Power Due to Sinusoidal Excitation
Let us change the voltage source in the circuit of Fig. 11.1 to the sinusoidal
source V m cos ωt . The familiar time-domain steady-state response is
i(t) = I m cos(ωt + φ)
where
I m = √
V m
R 2 + ω 2 L 2
and
φ = −tan −1
ωL
R
The instantaneous power delivered to the entire circuit in the sinusoidal
steady state is, therefore,
p(t) = v(t)i(t) = V m I m cos(ωt + φ) cos ωt
which we will find convenient to rewrite in a form obtained by using the
trigonometric identity for the product of two cosine functions. Thus,
p(t) =

V m I m
[cos(2ωt + φ) + cos φ]

The last equation possesses several characteristics that are true in general
for circuits in the sinusoidal steady state. One term, the first, is not a function
of time; and a second term is included which has a cyclic variation at twice
the applied frequency. Since this term is a cosine wave, and since sine waves
and cosine waves have average values which are zero (when averaged over
an integral number of periods), this example suggests that the average
power is 12 V m I m cos φ; as we will see shortly, this is indeed the case.

CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS
EXAMPLE 11.1
A voltage source, 40 + 60u(t) V, a 5 μF capacitor, and a 200
resistor form a series circuit. Find the power being absorbed by the
capacitor and by the resistor at t 1.2 ms.
At t = 0 − , no current is flowing and so 40 V appears across the capaci-
tor. At t = 0 + , the voltage across the capacitor-resistor series combina-
tion jumps to 100 V. Since v C cannot change in zero time, the resistor
voltage at t = 0 + is 60 V.
The current flowing through all three elements at t = 0 + is therefore
60/200 = 300 mA and for t > 0 is given by
i(t) = 300e −t/τ
mA
where τ = RC = 1 ms. Thus, the current flowing at t = 1.2 ms is
90.36 mA, and the power being absorbed by the resistor at that instant
is simply
i 2 (t)R = 1.633 W
The instantaneous power absorbed by the capacitor is i(t)v C (t). Recog-
nizing that the total voltage across both elements for t > 0 will always
be 100 V, and that the resistor voltage is given by 60e −t/τ ,
v C (t) = 100 − 60e −t/τ
and we find that v C (1.2 ms) = 100 − 60e −1.2 = 81.93 V. Thus,
the power being absorbed by the capacitor at t = 1.2 ms is
(90.36 mA) (81.93 V) = 7.403 W.

11.2 AVERAGE POWER
•
When we speak of an average value for the instantaneous power, the time
interval over which the averaging process takes place must be clearly de-
fined. Let us first select a general interval of time from t 1 to t 2 . We may then
obtain the average value by integrating p(t) from t 1 to t 2 and dividing the
result by the time interval t 2 − t 1 . Thus,
P =
1
t 2 − t 1
t 2
t 1
p(t) dt
[5]
The average value is denoted by the capital letter P, since it is not a function
of time, and it usually appears without any specific subscripts that identify
it as an average value. Although P is not a function of time, it is a function425
SECTION 11.2 AVERAGE POWER
of t 1 and t 2 , the two instants of time which define the interval of integration.
This dependence of P on a specific time interval may be expressed in a
simpler manner if p(t) is a periodic function. We consider this important
case first.
Average Power for Periodic Waveforms
Let us assume that our forcing function and the circuit responses are all pe-
riodic; a steady-state condition has been reached, although not necessarily
the sinusoidal steady state. We may define a periodic function f (t) mathe-
matically by requiring that
f (t) = f (t + T )
[6]
where T is the period. We now show that the average value of the instanta-
neous power as expressed by Eq. [5] may be computed over an interval of
one period having an arbitrary beginning.
A general periodic waveform is shown in Fig. 11.3 and identified as
p(t). We first compute the average power by integrating from t 1 to a time t 2
which is one period later, t 2 = t 1 + T :
P 1 =
1
T
t 1 +T
t 1
p(t) dt
and then by integrating from some other time t x to t x + T :
P x =
1
T
t x +T
t x
p(t) dt
The equality of P 1 and P x should be evident from the graphical interpre-
tation of the integrals; the periodic nature of the curve requires the two areas
to be equal. Thus, the average power may be computed by integrating the
instantaneous power over any interval that is one period in length and then
dividing by the period:
1
T
P =
t x +T
t x
p(t) dt
[7]
It is important to note that we may also integrate over any integral number
of periods, provided that we divide by the same integral number of periods.
Thus,
P =
1
nT
t x +nT
t x
p(t) dt
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
[8]
If we carry this concept to the extreme by integrating over all time, another
useful result is obtained. We first provide ourselves with symmetrical limits
on the integral
P =
1
nT
nT /2
−nT /2
p(t) dt
and then take the limit as n becomes infinite,

■ FIGURE 11.3 The average value P of a periodic
function p(t) is the same over any period T.426
CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS
As long as p(t) is a mathematically well-behaved function, as all physi-
cal forcing functions and responses are, it is apparent that if a large integer
n is replaced by a slightly larger number which is not an integer, then the
value of the integral and of P is changed by a negligible amount; moreover,
the error decreases as n increases. Without justifying this step rigorously,
we therefore replace the discrete variable nT with the continuous variable τ :

[9]
We will find it convenient on several occasions to integrate periodic func-
tions over this “infinite period.”
Average Power in the Sinusoidal Steady State
Now let us obtain the general result for the sinusoidal steady state. We
assume the general sinusoidal voltage
v(t) = V m cos(ωt + θ)
and current
i(t) = I m cos(ωt + φ)
associated with the device in question. The instantaneous power is
p(t) = V m I m cos(ωt + θ) cos(ωt + φ)
Again expressing the product of two cosine functions as one-half the
sum of the cosine of the difference angle and the cosine of the sum angle,
p(t) = 12 V m I m cos(θ − φ) + 12 V m I m cos(2ωt + θ + φ)
Recall that T =
1
2π
=
.
f
ω
[10]
we may save ourselves some integration by an inspection of the result.
The first term is a constant, independent of t. The remaining term is a cosine
function; p(t) is therefore periodic, and its period is 12 T . Note that the pe-
riod T is associated with the given current and voltage, and not with the
power; the power function has a period 12 T . However, we may integrate
over an interval of T to determine the average value if we wish; it is neces-
sary only that we also divide by T. Our familiarity with cosine and sine
waves, however, shows that the average value of either over a period is zero.
There is thus no need to integrate Eq. [10] formally; by inspection, the av-
erage value of the second term is zero over a period T (or 12 T ), and the av-
erage value of the first term, a constant, must be that constant itself. Thus,
P = 12 V m I m cos(θ − φ)
[11]
This important result, introduced in the previous section for a specific
circuit, is therefore quite general for the sinusoidal steady state. The average
power is one-half the product of the crest amplitude of the voltage, the crest
amplitude of the current, and the cosine of the phase-angle difference be-
tween the current and the voltage; the sense of the difference is immaterial.
Two special cases are worth isolating for consideration: the average
power delivered to an ideal resistor and that to an ideal reactor (any combi-
nation of only capacitors and inductors).SECTION 11.2 AVERAGE POWER

average power and an expression for the instantaneous power that
result when the corresponding phasor voltage V 4/0° V is applied

The phasor current is V/Z = 2/−60 ◦ A, and so the average power is

Average Power Absorbed by an Ideal Resistor
The phase-angle difference between the current through and the voltage
across a pure resistor is zero. Thus,
P R = 12 V m I m cos 0 = 12 V m I m
Keep in mind that we are computing the average
power delivered to a resistor by a sinusoidal source;
take care not to confuse this quantity with the
instantaneous power, which has a similar form.

The last two formulas, enabling us to determine the average power de-
livered to a pure resistance from a knowledge of either the sinusoidal cur-
rent or voltage, are simple and important. Unfortunately, they are often mis-
used. The most common error is made in trying to apply them in cases
where the voltage included in Eq. [13] is not the voltage across the resistor.
If care is taken to use the current through the resistor in Eq. [12] and the
voltage across the resistor in Eq. [13], satisfactory operation is guaranteed.
Also, do not forget the factor of 12 !
P R =
Average Power Absorbed by Purely Reactive Elements
The average power delivered to any device which is purely reactive (i.e.,
contains no resistors) must be zero. This is a direct result of the 90 ◦ phase dif-
ference which must exist between current and voltage; hence, cos(θ − φ) =
cos ± 90 ◦ = 0 and
P X = 0
The average power delivered to any network composed entirely of ideal
inductors and capacitors is zero; the instantaneous power is zero only at spe-
cific instants. Thus, power flows into the network for a part of the cycle and
out of the network during another portion of the cycle, with no power lost.
EXAMPLE 11.3
Find the average power being delivered to an impedance
Z L 8 − j11 by a current I 5/20 ◦ A.
We may find the solution quite rapidly by using Eq. [12]. Only the 8

nent will not absorb any average power. Thus,

Without even analyzing the circuit, we already know that the average

The values of I 1 and I 2 are found by any of several methods, such
as mesh analysis, nodal analysis, or superposition. They are
I 1 = 5 − j10 = 11.18/−63.43 ◦ A
I 2 = 5 − j5 = 7.071/−45 ◦ A
The downward current through the 2 resistor is
I 1 − I 2 = − j5 = 5/−90 ◦ A
so that I m = 5 A, and the average power absorbed by the resistor is
found most easily by Eq. [12]:
P R = 12 I m 2 R = 12 (5 2 )2 = 25 W
This result may be checked by using Eq. [11] or Eq. [13]. We next turn
to the left source. The voltage 20/0 ◦ V and associated current I 1 =
11.18/−63.43 ◦ A satisfy the active sign convention, and thus the power
delivered by this source is
P left = 12 (20)(11.18) cos[0 ◦ − (−63.43 ◦ )] = 50 W
In a similar manner, we find the power absorbed by the right source
using the passive sign convention,
P right = 12 (10)(7.071) cos(0 ◦ + 45 ◦ ) = 25 W
Since 50 = 25 + 25, the power relations check.

Maximum Power Transfer
We previously considered the maximum power transfer theorem as it applied
to resistive loads and resistive source impedances. For a Thévenin source
V th and impedance Z th = R th + jX th connected to a load Z L = R L + j X L ,
it may be shown that the average power delivered to the load is a maxi-
mum when R L = R th and X L = −X th , that is, when Z L = Z ∗ th . This result
is often dignified by calling it the maximum power transfer theorem for the
sinusoidal steady state:
An independent voltage source in series with an impedance Z th or an
independent current source in parallel with an impedance Z th delivers
a maximum average power to that load impedance Z L which is the
conjugate of Z th , or Z L = Z ∗ th .

ponents, R th + jX th , and in a similar fashion the load impedance Z L may be
written as R L + jX L . The current flowing through the loop is

EXAMPLE 11.5
A particular circuit is composed of the series combination of a
sinusoidal voltage source 3 cos(100t − 3°) V, a 500 resistor, a

that the voltage source is delivering maximum average power to
the unknown impedance, what is its value?
The phasor representation of the circuit is sketched in Fig. 11.8.
The circuit is easily seen as an unknown impedance Z ? in series with
a Thévenin equivalent consisting of the 3/−3 ◦ V source and a
Thévenin impedance 500 + j3 .
Since the circuit of Fig. 11.8 is already in the form required to
employ the maximum average power transfer theorem, we know that
maximum average power will be transferred to an impedance equal to
the complex conjugate of Z th , or
Z ? = Z ∗ th = 500 − j3
This impedance can be constructed in several ways, the simplest being
a 500 resistor in series with a capacitor having impedance − j3 .

sponds to a capacitance of 3.333 mF.

Average Power for Nonperiodic Functions
We should pay some attention to nonperiodic functions. One practical ex-
ample of a nonperiodic power function for which an average power value is
desired is the power output of a radio telescope directed toward a “radio
star.” Another is the sum of a number of periodic functions, each function
having a different period, such that no greater common period can be found
for the combination. For example, the current

CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS
is nonperiodic because the ratio of the periods of the two sine waves is an
irrational number. At t = 0, both terms are zero and increasing. But the first
term is zero and increasing only when t = 2πn, where n is an integer, and
thus periodicity demands that πt or π(2πn) must equal 2πm, where m
is also an integer. No solution (integral values for both m and n) for this
equation is possible. It may be illuminating to compare the nonperiodic
expression in Eq. [15] with the periodic function
i(t) = sin t + sin 3.14t
[16]
where 3.14 is an exact decimal expression and is not to be interpreted as
3.141592. . . . With a little effort, 2 it can be shown that the period of this cur-
rent wave is 100π seconds.
The average value of the power delivered to a 1 resistor by either a pe-
riodic current such as Eq. [16] or a nonperiodic current such as Eq. [15] may
be found by integrating over an infinite interval. Much of the actual inte-
gration can be avoided because of our thorough knowledge of the average
values of simple functions. We therefore obtain the average power delivered
by the current in Eq. [15] by applying Eq. [9]:

τ →∞ τ
P = lim

(sin 2 t + sin 2 πt + 2 sin t sin πt) dt
We now consider P as the sum of three average values. The average
value of sin 2 t over an infinite interval is found by replacing sin 2 t with
( 12 − 12 cos 2t); the average is simply 12 . Similarly, the average value of sin 2 πt
is also 12 . And the last term can be expressed as the sum of two cosine func-
tions, each of which must certainly have an average value of zero. Thus,
P =

An identical result is obtained for the periodic current of Eq. [16].

sinusoids of different periods and arbitrary amplitudes,

The result is unchanged if an arbitrary phase angle is assigned to each

surprising, because it shows that, in this special case of a current such as
Eq. [17], where each term has a unique frequency, superposition is applic-
able to power. Superposition is not applicable for a current which is the sum
of two direct currents, nor is it applicable for a current which is the sum of
two sinusoids of the same frequency.
11.3 EFFECTIVE VALUES OF CURRENT AND VOLTAGE
•
In North America, most power outlets deliver a sinusoidal voltage having a
frequency of 60 Hz and a “voltage” of 115 V (elsewhere, 50 Hz and 240 V
are typically encountered). But what is meant by “115 volts”? This is cer-
tainly not the instantaneous value of the voltage, for the voltage is not a con-
stant. The value of 115 V is also not the amplitude which we have been
symbolizing as V m ; if we displayed the voltage waveform on a calibrated
oscilloscope, we √ would find that the amplitude of this voltage at one of our
ac outlets is 115 2, or 162.6, volts. We also cannot fit the concept of an av-
erage value to the 115 V, because the average value of the sine wave is zero.
We might come a little closer by trying the magnitude of the average over a
positive or negative half cycle; by using a rectifier-type voltmeter at the out-
let, we should measure 103.5 V. As it turns out, however, 115 V is the
effective value of this sinusoidal voltage; it is a measure of the effectiveness
of a voltage source in delivering power to a resistive load.
Effective Value of a Periodic Waveform
Let us arbitrarily define effective value in terms of a current waveform, al-
though a voltage could equally well be selected. The effective value of any
periodic current is equal to the value of the direct current which, flowing
through an R ohm resistor, delivers the same average power to the resistor
as does the periodic current.
In other words, we allow the given periodic current to flow through the
resistor, determine the instantaneous power i 2 R, and then find the average
value of i 2 R over a period; this is the average power. We then cause a direct434

current to flow through this same resistor and adjust the value of the direct
current until the same value of average power is obtained. The resulting
magnitude of the direct current is equal to the effective value of the given
periodic current. These ideas are illustrated in Fig. 11.9.
The general mathematical expression for the effective value of i(t) is
now easily obtained. The average power delivered to the resistor by the
periodic current i(t) is

where the period of i(t) is T. The power delivered by the direct current is

value of i(t) is equal to I eff , and the effective value of
v(t) is equal to V eff .

The result is independent of the resistance R, as it must be to provide us with
a worthwhile concept. A similar expression is obtained for the effective
value of a periodic voltage by replacing i and I eff by v and V eff , respectively.
Notice that the effective value is obtained by first squaring the time func-
tion, then taking the average value of the squared function over a period, and
finally taking the square root of the average of the squared function. In short,
the operation involved in finding an effective value is the (square) root of the
mean of the square; for this reason, the effective value is often called the
root-mean-square value, or simply the rms value.
Effective (RMS) Value of a Sinusoidal Waveform
The most important special case is that of the sinusoidal waveform. Let us
select the sinusoidal current
i(t) = I m cos(ωt + φ)
which has a period
T =

Thus the effective value of a sinusoidal current is a real quantity
which is in-

dependent of the phase angle and numerically

to
√
the amplitude of the current. A current 2 cos(ωt + φ) A, therefore, has an
effective value of 1 A and will deliver the same average power to any resis-
tor as will a direct current of 1 A.
√
It should be noted carefully that the 2 factor that we obtained as the ratio
of the amplitude of the periodic current to the effective value is applicable
only when the periodic function is sinusoidal. For a sawtooth waveform, √ for
example, the effective value is equal to the maximum value divided by 3.
The factor by which the maximum value must be divided to obtain the effec-
tive value depends on the mathematical form of the given periodic function;
it may be either rational or irrational, depending on the nature of the function.
Use of RMS Values to Compute Average Power
The use of the effective value also simplifies slightly the expression for the
average power delivered by a sinusoidal current or voltage by avoiding use
of the factor 12 . For example, the average power delivered to an R ohm
resistor by a sinusoidal current is
Since I eff
P = 12 I m 2 R
√
= I m / 2, the average power may be written as
2
P = I eff
R
[20]
The other power expressions may also be written in terms of effective values:
P = V eff I eff cos(θ − φ)
V 2
P = eff
R
[21]
[22]
Although we have succeeded in eliminating the factor 12 from our
average-power relationships, we must now take care to determine whether
a sinusoidal quantity is expressed in terms of its amplitude or its effective
value. In practice, the effective value is usually used in the fields of power
transmission or distribution and of rotating machinery; in the areas of elec-
tronics and communications, the amplitude is more often used. We will as-
sume that the amplitude is specified unless the term “rms” is explicitly used,
or we are otherwise instructed.
In the sinusoidal steady state, phasor voltages and currents may be
given either as effective
√ values or as amplitudes; the two expressions dif-
fer only by a factor of 2. The voltage 50/30 ◦ V is expressed in terms of
an amplitude; as an rms voltage, we should describe the same voltage as
35.4/30 ◦ V rms.
Effective Value with Multiple-Frequency Circuits
In order to determine the effective value of a periodic or nonperiodic
waveform which is composed of the sum of a number of sinusoids of dif-
ferent frequencies, we may use the appropriate average-power relation-
ship of Eq. [18], developed in Sec. 11.2, rewritten in terms of the effective
values of the several components:
2
2
P = I 1eff
+ I 2eff
+ · · · + I N 2 eff R
[23]
The fact that the effective value is defined in terms of an
equivalent dc quantity provides us with average-power
formulas for resistive circuits which are identical with
those used in dc analysis.436
CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS
From this we see that the effective value of a current which is composed
of any number of sinusoidal currents of different frequencies can be
expressed as
I eff =
2
2
I 1eff
+ I 2eff
+ · · · + I N 2 eff
[24]
These results indicate that if a sinusoidal current of 5 A rms at 60 Hz flows
through a 2 resistor, an average power of 5 2 (2) = 50 W is absorbed by
the resistor; if a second current—perhaps 3 A rms at 120 Hz, for example—
is also present, the absorbed power is 3 2 (2) + 50 = 68 W. Using Eq. [24]
instead, we find that the effective value of the sum of the 60 and 120 Hz
currents is 5.831 A. Thus, P = 5.831 2 (2) = 68 W as before. However,
if the second current is also at 60 Hz, the effective value of the sum of the
two 60 Hz currents may have any value between 2 and 8 A. Thus, the ab-
sorbed power may have any value between 8 W and 128 W, depending on
the relative phase of the two current components.

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
Several useful techniques are available through PSpice for calculation
of power quantities. In particular, the built-in functions of Probe allow
us to both plot the instantaneous power and compute the average
power. For example, consider the simple voltage divider circuit of
Fig. 11.10, which is being driven by a 60 Hz sine wave with an

The current along with the instantaneous power dissipated in resistor
R1 is plotted in Fig. 11.11 by employing the Add Plot to Window
option under Plot. The instantaneous power is periodic, with a nonzero
average value and a peak of 6.61 W.
■ FIGURE 11.11 Current and instantaneous power associated with resistor R1 of Fig. 11.10.
The easiest means of using Probe to obtain the average power,

As can be seen in Fig. 11.12, the average value of the power over
either one or two periods is 3.305 W, in agreement with the hand
calculation. Note that since PSpice only calculates at specific times, the
circuit was not simulated at precisely 8.333 ms and hence Cursor 1 in-
dicates a slightly higher average power.
Probe also allows us to compute the average over a specific interval
using the built-in function avgx. For example, to use this function to
compute the average power over a single period, which in this case is
1/120 = 8.33 ms, we would enter

Either approach will result in a value of 3.305 W at the endpoint of
the plot.

11.4 APPARENT POWER AND POWER FACTOR
•
Historically, the introduction of the concepts of apparent power and power
factor can be traced to the electric power industry, where large amounts of
electric energy must be transferred from one point to another; the efficiency
with which this transfer is effected is related directly to the cost of the elec-
tric energy, which is eventually paid by the consumer. Customers who pro-
vide loads which result in a relatively poor transmission efficiency must pay
a greater price for each kilowatthour (kWh) of electric energy they actually
receive and use. In a similar way, customers who require a costlier invest-
ment in transmission and distribution equipment by the power company
will also pay more for each kilowatthour unless the company is benevolent
and enjoys losing money.
Let us first define apparent power and power factor and then show
briefly how these terms are related to practical economic situations. We
assume that the sinusoidal voltage
v = V m cos(ωt + θ)
is applied to a network and the resultant sinusoidal current is
i = I m cos(ωt + φ)
The phase angle by which the voltage leads the current is therefore (θ − φ).
The average power delivered to the network, assuming a passive signSECTION 11.4 APPARENT POWER AND POWER FACTOR
439
convention at its input terminals, may be expressed either in terms of the
maximum values:
P = 12 V m I m cos(θ − φ)
or in terms of the effective values:
P = V eff I eff cos(θ − φ)
If our applied voltage and current responses had been dc quantities,
the average power delivered to the network would have been given
simply by the product of the voltage and the current. Applying this dc
technique to the sinusoidal problem, we should obtain a value for the
absorbed power which is “apparently’’ given by the familiar product V eff
I eff . However, this product of the effective values of the voltage and cur-
rent is not the average power; we define it as the apparent power. Di-
mensionally, apparent power must be measured in the same units as real
power, since cos(θ − φ) is dimensionless; but in order to avoid confu-
sion, the term volt-amperes, or VA, is applied to the apparent power.
Since cos(θ − φ) cannot have a magnitude greater than unity, the magni-
tude of the real power can never be greater than the magnitude of the
apparent power.
The ratio of the real or average power to the apparent power is called the
power factor, symbolized by PF. Hence,
PF =
average power
P
=
apparent power
V eff I eff
In the sinusoidal case, the power factor is simply cos(θ − φ), where
(θ − φ) is the angle by which the voltage leads the current. This relation-
ship is the reason why the angle (θ − φ) is often referred to as the PF
angle.
For a purely resistive load, the voltage and current are in phase, (θ − φ)
is zero, and the PF is unity. In other words, the apparent power and the
average power are equal. Unity PF, however, may also be achieved for loads
that contain both inductance and capacitance if the element values and
the operating frequency are carefully selected to provide an input imped-
ance having a zero phase angle. A purely reactive load, that is, one contain-
ing no resistance, will cause a phase difference between the voltage and
current of either plus or minus 90°, and the PF is therefore zero.
Between these two extreme cases there are the general networks for
which the PF can range from zero to unity. A PF of 0.5, for example, indi-
cates a load having an input impedance with a phase angle of either 60° or
−60 ◦ ; the former describes an inductive load, since the voltage leads the
current by 60°, while the latter refers to a capacitive load. The ambiguity in
the exact nature of the load is resolved by referring to a leading PF or a lag-
ging PF, the terms leading or lagging referring to the phase of the current
with respect to the voltage. Thus, an inductive load will have a lagging PF
and a capacitive load a leading PF.
Apparent power is not a concept which is limited to
sinusoidal forcing functions and responses. It may be
determined for any current and voltage waveshapes by
simply taking the product of the effective values of the
current and voltage.440

11.5 COMPLEX POWER
•
As we saw in Chap. 10, “complex” numbers do not actually “complicate”
analysis. By allowing us to carry two pieces of information together
through a series of calculations via the “real” and “imaginary” compo-
nents, they often greatly simplify what might otherwise be tedious calcu-
lations. This is particularly true with power, since we have resistive as
well as inductive and capacitive elements in a general load. In this sec-
tion, we define complex power to allow us to calculate the various con-
tributions to the total power in a clean, efficient fashion. The magnitude
of the complex power is simply the apparent power. The real part is the
average power and—as we are about to see—the imaginary part is a new
quantity, termed the reactive power, which describes the rate of energy
transfer into and out of reactive load components (e.g., inductors and
capacitors).
We define complex power with reference to a general sinusoidal voltage
V eff = V eff /θ across a pair of terminals and a general sinusoidal current
I eff = I eff φ flowing into one of the terminals in such a way as to satisfy
the passive sign convention. The average power P absorbed by the two-
terminal network is thus
P = V eff I eff cos(θ − φ)
Complex nomenclature is next introduced by making use of Euler’s formula
in the same way as we did in introducing phasors. We express P as
P = V eff I eff Re{e j (θ−φ) }
2 – j1 ⍀
Z L442
CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS
or
P = Re{V eff e jθ I eff e − jφ }
The phasor voltage may now be recognized as the first two factors within
the brackets in the preceding equation, but the second two factors do not
quite correspond to the phasor current, because the angle includes a minus
sign, which is not present in the expression for the phasor current. That is,
the phasor current is
I eff = I eff e jφ
and we therefore must make use of conjugate notation:
I ∗ eff = I eff e − jφ
Hence
P = Re{V eff I ∗ eff }
and we may now let power become complex by defining the complex power
S as
S = V eff I ∗ eff
[25]
If we first inspect the polar or exponential form of the complex power,
S = V eff I eff e j (θ−φ)
we see that the magnitude of S, V eff I eff , is the apparent power. The angle of
S, (θ − φ), is the PF angle (i.e., the angle by which the voltage leads the
current).
In rectangular form, we have
S = P + jQ
[26]
where P is the average power, as before. The imaginary part of the complex
power is symbolized as Q and is termed the reactive power. The dimensions
of Q are the same as those of the real power P, the complex power S, and
the apparent power |S|. In order to avoid confusion with these other quanti-
ties, the unit of Q is defined as the volt-ampere-reactive (abbreviated VAR).
From Eqs. [25] and [26], it is seen that
The sign of the reactive power characterizes the nature
of a passive load at which V eff and I eff are specified. If
the load is inductive, then (θ − φ) is an angle between
0 and 90°, the sine of this angle is positive, and the
reactive power is positive. A capacitive load results in
a negative reactive power.
Im
Q = V eff I eff sin(θ − φ)
[27]
The physical interpretation of reactive power is the time rate of energy flow
back and forth between the source (i.e., the utility company) and the reac-
tive components of the load (i.e., inductances and capacitances). These
components alternately charge and discharge, which leads to current flow
from and to the source, respectively.
The relevant quantities are summarized in Table 11.1 for convenience.

the first quadrant (θ − φ > 0); the power factor is lagging (corresponding
to an inductive load); and if the power triangle lies in the fourth quadrant

load). A great deal of qualitative information concerning our load is there-
fore available at a glance.
Another interpretation of reactive power may be seen by constructing a
phasor diagram containing V eff and I eff as shown in Fig. 11.16. If the phasor
current is resolved into two components, one in phase with the voltage, hav-
ing a magnitude I eff cos(θ − φ), and one 90° out of phase with the voltage,
with magnitude equal to I eff sin |θ − φ|, then it is clear that the real power
is given by the product of the magnitude of the voltage phasor and the
component of the phasor current which is in phase with the voltage. More-
over, the product of the magnitude of the voltage phasor and the component
of the phasor current which is 90° out of phase with the voltage is the reac-
tive power Q. It is common to speak of the component of a phasor which is
90° out of phase with some other phasor as a quadrature component. Thus
Q is simply V eff times the quadrature component of I eff . Q is also known as
the quadrature power.
Power Measurement
Strictly speaking, a wattmeter measures average real power P drawn by a
load, and a varmeter reads the average reactive power Q drawn by a
load. However, it is common to find both features in the same meter, which
is often also capable of measuring apparent power and power factor
(Fig. 11.17).

Power Factor Correction
When electric power is being supplied to large industrial
consumers by a power company, the company will fre-
quently include a PF clause in its rate schedules. Under
this clause, an additional charge is made to the consumer
whenever the PF drops below a certain specified value,
usually about 0.85 lagging. Very little industrial power is
consumed at leading PFs, because of the nature of typi-
cal industrial loads. There are several reasons that force
the power company to make this additional charge for
low PFs. In the first place, it is evident that larger
current-carrying capacity must be built into its genera-
tors in order to provide the larger currents that go with
lower-PF operation at constant power and constant volt-
age. Another reason is found in the increased losses in its
transmission and distribution system.
In an effort to recoup losses and encourage its cus-
tomers to operate at high PF, a certain utility charges a
penalty of $0.22/kVAR for each kVAR above a bench-
mark value computed as 0.62 times the average power
demand:

Average Power (kW)
■ FIGURE 11.18 Plot showing acceptable ratio of reactive power to
average power for power factor benchmark of 0.85 lagging.
The reactive power requirement is commonly ad-
justed through the installation of compensation capaci-
tors placed in parallel with the load (typically at the
substation outside the customer’s facility). The value of
the required capacitance can be shown to be
S = P + j Q = P + j0.62P = P(1 + j0.62)
= P(1.177/31.8 ◦ )
This benchmark targets a PF of 0.85 lagging, as
cos 31.8° = 0.85 and Q is positive; this is represented
graphically in Fig. 11.18. Customers with a PF smaller
than the benchmark value are subject to financial penalties.

It is easy to show that the complex power delivered to several intercon-
nected loads is the sum of the complex powers delivered to each of the
individual loads, no matter how the loads are interconnected. For example,
consider the two loads shown connected in parallel in Fig. 11.20. If rms
values are assumed, the complex power drawn by the combined load is
S = VI ∗ = V(I 1 + I 2 ) ∗ = V(I ∗ 1 + I ∗ 2 )
and thus
S = VI ∗ 1 + VI ∗ 2
as stated.

however, compensation capacitor banks are manufac-
tured in specific increments rated in units of kVAR
capacity. An example of such an installation is shown in
Fig. 11.19.
Now let us consider a specific example. A particular
industrial machine plant has a monthly peak demand
of 5000 kW and a monthly reactive requirement of
6000 kVAR. Using the rate schedule above, what is the
annual cost to this utility customer associated with PF
penalties? If compensation is available through the

utility company at a cost of $2390 per 1000 kVAR in-
crement and $3130 per 2000 kVAR increment, what is
the most cost-effective solution for the customer?
The PF of the installation is the angle of the complex
power S, which in this case is 5000 + j6000 kVA. Thus,
the angle is tan −1 (6000/5000) = 50.19 ◦ and the PF is
0.64 lagging. The benchmark reactive power value, com-
puted as 0.62 times the peak demand, is 0.62(5000) =
3100 kVAR. So, the plant is drawing 6000 − 3100 =
2900 kVAR more reactive power than the utility company
is willing to allow without penalty. This represents an
annual assessment of 12(2900)(0.22) = $7656 in addi-
tion to regular electricity costs.
If the customer chooses to have a single 1000 kVAR
increment installed (at a cost of $2390), the excess
reactive power draw is reduced to 2900 − 1000 =
1900 kVAR, so that the annual penalty is now
12(1900)(0.22) = $5016. The total cost this year is then
$5016 + $2390 = $7406, for a savings of $250. If the
customer chooses to have a single 2000 kVAR incre-
ment installed (at a cost of $3130), the excess reactive
power draw is reduced to 2900 − 2000 = 900 kVAR, so
that the annual penalty is now 12(900)(0.22) = $2376.
The total cost this year is then $2376 + $3130 =
$5506, for a first-year savings of $2150. If, however,
the customer goes overboard and installs 3000 kVAR of
compensation capacitors so that no penalty is assessed,
it will actually cost $14 more in the first year than if
only 2000 kVAR were installed.
EXAMPLE 11.9
An industrial consumer is operating a 50 kW (67.1 hp) induction
motor at a lagging PF of 0.8. The source voltage is 230 V rms. In
order to obtain lower electrical rates, the customer wishes to raise
the PF to 0.95 lagging. Specify a suitable solution.
Although the PF might be raised by increasing the real power and
maintaining the reactive power constant, this would not result in a
lower bill and is not a cure that interests the consumer. A purely reac-
tive load must be added to the system, and it is clear that it must be
added in parallel, since the supply voltage to the induction motor must
not change. The circuit of Fig. 11.21 is thus applicable if we interpret
S 1 as the induction motor’s complex power and S 2 as the complex
power drawn by the corrective device.

CHAPTER 11 AC CIRCUIT POWER ANALYSIS
The complex power supplied to the induction motor must have a real
part of 50 kW and an angle of cos −1 (0.8), or 36.9°. Hence,
S 1 =
50/36.9 ◦
= 50 + j37.5 kVA

In order to achieve a PF of 0.95, the total complex power must become
S = S 1 + S 2 =
50
cos −1 (0.95) = 50 + j16.43 kVA
0.95
Thus, the complex power drawn by the corrective load is
S 2 = − j21.07 kVA
The necessary load impedance Z 2 may be found in several simple
steps. We select a phase angle of 0° for the voltage source, and
therefore the current drawn by Z 2 is

If the operating frequency is 60 Hz, this load can be provided by a

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In this chapter, we introduced a fair number of new power-related terms
(summarized in Table 11.2), which might have come as a bit of a surprise af-
ter watts did so well for us up to this point. The new terminology is largely
relevant to ac power systems, where voltages and currents are generally as-
sumed to be sinusoidal (the prevalence of switched-mode power supplies in
many computer systems can alter this situation, a topic of more advanced
power engineering texts). After clarifying what is meant by instantaneous
power, we discussed the concept of average power P. This quantity is not a
function of time, but is a strong function of the phase difference between
sinusoidal voltage and current waveforms. Purely reactive elements such as
ideal inductors and capacitors absorb zero average power. Since such ele-
ments do increase the magnitude of the current flowing between the source
and load, however, two new terms find common usage: apparent power and
power factor. The average power and apparent power are identical when
voltage and current are in phase (i.e., associated with a purely resistive
load). The power factor gives us a numerical guage of how reactive a

in time. It is not the product of the voltage and current phasors!

is the angle of the voltage and φ is the angle of the current.

particular load is: a unity power factor (PF) corresponds to a purely resistive
load (if inductors are present, they are being “canceled” by an appropriate
capacitance); a zero PF indicates a purely reactive load, and the sign of the
angle indicates whether the load is capacitive or inductive. Putting all of
these concepts together allowed us to create a more compact representation
known as complex power, S. The magnitude of S is the apparent power, P is
the real part of S, and Q, the reactive power (zero for resistive loads), is the
imaginary part of S.
Along the way, we paused to introduce the notion of effective values of
current and voltage, often referred to as rms values. Care must be taken
from this point forward to establish whether a particular voltage or current
value is being quoted as a magnitude or its corresponding rms value, as an
∼40% error can be introduced. Interestingly, we also discovered an exten-
sion of the maximum power theorem encountered in Chap. 5, namely, that
maximum average power is delivered to a load whose impedance Z L is the
complex conjugate of the Thévenin equivalent impedance of the network to
which it is connected.
For convenience, key points of the chapter are summarized below, along
with corresponding example numbers.
❑ The instantaneous power absorbed by an element is given by the
expression p(t) = v(t)i(t). (Examples 11.1, 11.2)
❑ The average power delivered to an impedance by a sinusoidal source
is 12 V m I m cos(θ − φ), where θ = the voltage phase angle and φ = the
phase angle of the current. (Example 11.2)
❑ Only the resistive component of a load draws nonzero average power.
The average power delivered to the reactive component of a load is
zero. (Examples 11.3, 11.4)
❑ Maximum average power transfer occurs when the condition Z L = Z ∗ th
is satisfied. (Example 11.5)
❑ When multiple sources are present, each operating at a different
frequency, the individual contributions to average power may be
summed. This is not true for sources operating at the same frequency.
(Examples 11.6, 11.7)
❑ The effective or rms value √ of a sinusoidal waveform is obtained by
dividing its amplitude by 2.
❑ The power factor (PF) of a load is the ratio of its average dissipated
power to the apparent power. (Example 11.8)
❑ A purely resistive load will have a unity power factor. A purely reactive
load will have a zero power factor. (Example 11.8)
❑ Complex power is defined as S = P + jQ, or S = V eff I ∗ eff . It is measured
in units of volt-amperes (VA). (Example 11.9)
❑ Reactive power Q is the imaginary component of the complex power,
and is a measure of the energy flow rate into or out of the reactive
components of a load. Its unit is the volt-ampere-reactive (VAR).
(Example 11.9)
❑ Capacitors are commonly used to improve the PF of industrial loads
to minimize the reactive power required from the utility company.

12 Polyphase Circuits
KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
The vast majority of power is supplied to consumers in the form of
sinusoidal voltages and currents, typically referred to as alternating
current or simply ac. Although there are exceptions, for example,
some types of train motors, most equipment is designed to run on
either 50 or 60 Hz. Most 60 Hz systems are now standardized to
run on 120 V, whereas 50 Hz systems typically correspond to
240 V (both voltages being quoted in rms units). The actual voltage
delivered to an appliance can vary somewhat from these values,
and distribution systems employ significantly higher voltages to
minimize the current and hence cable size. Originally Thomas
Edison advocated a purely dc power distribution network, purport-
edly due to his preference for the simple algebra required to
analyze such circuits. Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, two
other pioneers in the field of electricity, proposed ac distribution
systems as the achievable losses were significantly lower. Ulti-
mately they were more persuasive, despite some rather theatrical
demonstrations on the part of Edison.
The transient response of ac power systems is of interest
when determining the peak power demand, since most equipment
requires more current to start up than it does to run continuously.
Often, however, it is the steady-state operation that is of primary
interest, so our experience with phasor-based analysis will prove to
be handy. In this chapter we introduce a new type of voltage
source, the three-phase source, which can be connected in either a
three- or four-wire Y configuration or a three-wire configuration.
Loads can also be either Y- or -connected, depending on the
application.

POLYPHASE SYSTEMS
So far, whenever we used the term “sinusoidal source’’ we pictured a single
sinusoidal voltage or current having a particular amplitude, frequency, and
phase. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of polyphase sources, focus-
ing on three-phase systems in particular. There are distinct advantages in us-
ing rotating machinery to generate three-phase power rather than single-
phase power, and there are economical advantages in favor of the
transmission of power in a three-phase system. Although most of the electri-
cal equipment we have encountered so far is single-phase, three-phase
equipment is not uncommon, especially in manufacturing environments. In
particular, motors used in large refrigeration systems and in machining facil-
ities are often wired for three-phase power. For the remaining applications,
once we have become familiar with the basics of polyphase systems, we will
find that it is simple to obtain single-phase power by just connecting to a sin-
gle “leg’’ of a polyphase system.
Let us look briefly at the most common polyphase system, a balanced
three-phase system. The source has three terminals (not counting a neutral
or ground connection), and voltmeter measurements will show that sinu-
soidal voltages of equal amplitude are present between any two terminals.
However, these voltages are not in phase; each of the three voltages is 120°
out of phase with each of the other two, the sign of the phase angle depend-
ing on the sense of the voltages. One possible set of voltages is shown in
Fig. 12.1. A balanced load draws power equally from all three phases. At no
instant does the instantaneous power drawn by the total load reach zero;
in fact, the total instantaneous power is constant. This is an advantage in
rotating machinery, for it keeps the torque on the rotor much more constant
than it would be if a single-phase source were used. As a result, there is less
vibration.

SECTION 12.1 POLYPHASE SYSTEMS

The use of a higher number of phases, such as 6- and 12-phase systems,
is limited almost entirely to the supply of power to large rectifiers Recti-
fiers convert alternating current to direct current by only allowing current to
flow to the load in one direction, so that the sign of the voltage across the
load remains the same. The rectifier output is a direct current plus a smaller
pulsating component, or ripple, which decreases as the number of phases
increases.
Almost without exception, polyphase systems in practice contain
sources which may be closely approximated by ideal voltage sources or by
ideal voltage sources in series with small internal impedances. Three-phase
current sources are extremely rare.

It is convenient to describe polyphase voltages and currents using double-
subscript notation. With this notation, a voltage or current, such as V ab or
I a A , has more meaning than if it were indicated simply as V 3 or I x . By def-
inition, the voltage of point a with respect to point b is V ab . Thus, the plus
sign is located at a, as indicated in Fig. 12.2a. We therefore consider the
double subscripts to be equivalent to a plus-minus sign pair; the use of both
would be redundant. With reference to Fig. 12.2b, for example, we see that
V ad = V ab + V cd . The advantage of the double-subscript notation lies in
the fact that Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires the voltage between two
points to be the same, regardless of the path chosen between the points;
thus V ad = V ab + V bd = V ac + V cd = V ab + V bc + V cd , and so forth. The
benefit of this is that KVL may be satisfied without reference to the circuit
diagram; correct equations may be written even though a point, or subscript
letter, is included which is not marked on the diagram. For example, we
might have written V ad = V ax + V xd , where x identifies the location of any
interesting point of our choice.
One possible representation of a three-phase system of voltages 1 is
shown in Fig. 12.3. Let us assume that the voltages V an , V bn , and V cn are
known:
b
■ FIGURE 12.3 A network used as a numerical
example of double-subscript voltage notation.
V an = 100/0 ◦ V
V bn = 100/−120 ◦ V
V cn = 100/−240 ◦ V
The voltage V ab may be found, with an eye on the subscripts, as
V ab = V an + V nb = V an − V bn
= 100/0 ◦ − 100/−120 ◦ V
= 100 − (−50 − j86.6) V
= 173.2/30 ◦ V
The three given voltages and the construction of the phasor V ab are shown
on the phasor diagram of Fig. 12.4.
A double-subscript notation may also be applied to currents. We define
the current I ab as the current flowing from a to b by the most direct path. In

implicitly throughout this chapter.

every complete circuit we consider, there must of course be at least two pos-
sible paths between the points a and b, and we agree that we will not use
double-subscript notation unless it is obvious that one path is much shorter,
or much more direct. Usually this path is through a single element. Thus, the
current I ab is correctly indicated in Fig. 12.5. In fact, we do not even need
the direction arrow when talking about this current; the subscripts tell us the
direction. However, the identification of a current as I cd for the circuit of
Fig. 12.5 would cause confusion.

SINGLE-PHASE THREE-WIRE SYSTEMS
Before studying polyphase systems in detail, it can be helpful first to look
at a simple single-phase three-wire system. A single-phase three-wire
source is defined as a source having three output terminals, such as a, n,
and b in Fig. 12.7a, at which the phasor voltages V an and V nb are equal.
The source may therefore be represented by the combination of two iden-
tical voltage sources; in Fig. 12.7b, V an = V nb = V 1 . It is apparent that
V ab = 2V an = 2V nb , and we therefore have a source to which loads operat-
ing at either of two voltages may be connected. The normal North American
household system is single-phase three-wire, permitting the operation of
both 110 V and 220 V appliances. The higher-voltage appliances are nor-
mally those drawing larger amounts of power; operation at higher voltage
results in a smaller current draw for the same power. Smaller-diameter wire
may consequently be used safely in the appliance, the household distribution461
SECTION 12.2 SINGLE-PHASE THREE-WIRE SYSTEMS
system, and the distribution system of the utility company, as larger-diameter
wire must be used with higher currents to reduce the heat produced due to
the resistance of the wire.
The name single-phase arises because the voltages V an and V nb , being
equal, must have the same phase angle. From another viewpoint, however,
the voltages between the outer wires and the central wire, which is usually re-
ferred to as the neutral, are exactly 180 ◦ out of phase. That is, V an = −V bn ,
and V an + V bn = 0. Later, we will see that balanced polyphase systems are
characterized by a set of voltages of equal amplitude whose (phasor) sum is
zero. From this viewpoint, then, the single-phase three-wire system is really
a balanced two-phase system. Two-phase, however, is a term that is tradi-
tionally reserved for a relatively unimportant unbalanced system utilizing
two voltage sources 90° out of phase.
Let us now consider a single-phase three-wire system that contains
identical loads Z p between each outer wire and the neutral (Fig. 12.8). We
first assume that the wires connecting the source to the load are perfect
conductors. Since
V an = V nb
then,
I a A
V an
V nb
=
= I Bb =
Z p
Z p
and therefore
I n N = I Bb + I Aa = I Bb − I a A = 0
Thus there is no current in the neutral wire, and it could be removed with-
out changing any current or voltage in the system. This result is achieved
through the equality of the two loads and of the two sources.
Effect of Finite Wire Impedance
We next consider the effect of a finite impedance in each of the wires. If
lines a A and bB each have the same impedance, this impedance may be
added to Z p , resulting in two equal loads once more, and zero neutral cur-
rent. Now let us allow the neutral wire to possess some impedance Z n .
Without carrying out any detailed analysis, superposition should show us
that the symmetry of the circuit will still cause zero neutral current. More-
over, the addition of any impedance connected directly from one of the
outer lines to the other outer line also yields a symmetrical circuit and zero
neutral current. Thus, zero neutral current is a consequence of a balanced, or
symmetrical, load; nonzero impedance in the neutral wire does not destroy
the symmetry.
The most general single-phase three-wire system will contain unequal
loads between each outside line and the neutral and another load directly
between the two outer lines; the impedances of the two outer lines may be
expected to be approximately equal, but the neutral impedance is often
slightly larger. Let us consider an example of such a system, with particular
interest in the current that may flow now through the neutral wire, as well as
the overall efficiency with which our system is transmitting power to the
unbalanced load.

᭤ Identify the goal of the problem.
The three loads in the circuit are the 50 resistor, the 100 resistor,
and a 20 + j10 impedance. Each of the two lines has a resistance
of 1 , and the neutral wire has a resistance of 3 . We need the cur-
rent through each of these in order to determine power.
᭤ Collect the known information.
We have a single-phase three-wire system; the circuit diagram of
Fig. 12.9 is completely labeled. The computed currents will be in
rms units.
᭤ Devise a plan.
The circuit is conducive to mesh analysis, having three clearly defined
meshes. The result of the analysis will be a set of mesh currents,
which can then be used to compute absorbed power.
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.
The three mesh equations are:
−115/0 ◦ + I 1 + 50(I 1 − I 2 ) + 3(I 1 − I 3 ) = 0
(20 + j10)I 2 + 100(I 2 − I 3 ) + 50(I 2 − I 1 ) = 0
−115/0 ◦ + 3(I 3 − I 1 ) + 100(I 3 − I 2 ) + I 3 = 0
which can be rearranged to obtain the following three equations

We have a set of three equations in three unknowns, so it is possible
to attempt a solution at this point.463
SECTION 12.2 SINGLE-PHASE THREE-WIRE SYSTEMS
᭤ Attempt a solution.
Solving for the phasor currents I 1 , I 2 , and I 3 using a scientific calcula-
tor, we find
I 1 = 11.24/−19.83 ◦ A
I 2 = 9.389/−24.47 ◦ A
I 3 = 10.37/−21.80 ◦ A
The currents in the outer lines are thus
I a A = I 1 = 11.24/−19.83 ◦ A
and
I bB = −I 3 = 10.37/158.20 ◦ A
and the smaller neutral current is
I n N = I 3 − I 1 = 0.9459/−177.7 ◦ A
The average power drawn by each load may thus be determined:
P 50 = |I 1 − I 2 | 2 (50) = 206 W
P 100 = |I 3 − I 2 | 2 (100) = 117 W
P 20+ j10 = |I 2 | (20) = 1763 W
2
Note that we do not need to include a factor of
1
2
since
we are working with rms current values.
The total load power is 2086 W. The loss in each of the wires is next
found:
P a A = |I 1 | 2 (1) = 126 W
P bB = |I 3 | 2 (1) = 108 W
P n N = |I n N | 2 (3) = 3 W
giving a total line loss of 237 W. The wires are evidently quite long;
otherwise, the relatively high power loss in the two outer lines would
cause a dangerous temperature rise.
Imagine the heat produced by two 100 W light bulbs!
These outer wires must dissipate the same amount
of power. In order to keep their temperature down,
a large surface area is required.
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
The total absorbed power is 206 + 117 + 1763 + 237, or 2323 W,
which may be checked by finding the power delivered by each voltage
source:
P an = 115(11.24) cos 19.83 ◦ = 1216 W
P bn = 115(10.37) cos 21.80 ◦ = 1107 W
or a total of 2323 W. The transmission efficienc for the system is
η =
total power delivered to load
2086
=

2086 + 237
This value would be unbelievable for a steam engine or an internal
combustion engine, but it is too low for a well-designed distribution
system. Larger-diameter wires should be used if the source and the
load cannot be placed closer to each other.

THREE-PHASE Y-Y CONNECTION
Three-phase sources have three terminals, called the line terminals, and
they may or may not have a fourth terminal, the neutral connection. We will
begin by discussing a three-phase source that does have a neutral connec-
tion. It may be represented by three ideal voltage sources connected in a Y,
as shown in Fig. 12.11; terminals a, b, c, and n are available. We will con-
sider only balanced three-phase sources, which may be defined as having

and

These three voltages, each existing between one line and the neutral, are
called phase voltages. If we arbitrarily choose V an as the reference, or define
V an = V p /0 ◦
where we will consistently use V p to represent the rms amplitude of any of
the phase voltages, then the definition of the three-phase source indicates
that either
V bn = V p /−120 ◦ and V cn = V p /−240 ◦
V bn = V p /120 ◦ and V cn = V p /240 ◦

The actual phase sequence of a physical three-phase source depends on the
arbitrary choice of the three terminals to be lettered a, b, and c. They may
always be chosen to provide positive phase sequence, and we will assume
that this has been done in most of the systems we consider.
Line-to-Line Voltages
Let us next find the line-to-line voltages (often simply called the line
voltages) which are present when the phase voltages are those of Fig. 12.12a.
It is easiest to do this with the help of a phasor diagram, since the angles are
all multiples of 30 ◦ . The necessary construction is shown in Fig. 12.13; the
results are
√
[1]
V ab = 3V p /30 ◦
√
◦
V bc = 3V p /−90
[2]
√
◦
V ca = 3V p /−210
[3]
Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires the sum of these three voltages to be zero;
the reader is encouraged to verify this as an exercise.
If the rms amplitude of any of the line voltages is denoted by V L , then
one of the important characteristics of the Y-connected three-phase source
may be expressed as
√
V L = 3V p
Note that with positive phase sequence, V an leads V bn and V bn leads
V cn , in each case by 120 ◦ , and also that V ab leads V bc and V bc leads V ca ,
again by 120 ◦ . The statement is true for negative phase sequence if “lags’’
is substituted for “leads.’’
Now let us connect a balanced Y-connected three-phase load to our
source, using three lines and a neutral, as drawn in Fig. 12.14. The load is

and therefore
I N n = I a A + I bB + I cC = 0
Thus, the neutral carries no current if the source and load are both bal-
anced and if the four wires have zero impedance. How will this change if an
impedance Z L is inserted in series with each of the three lines and an imped-
ance Z n is inserted in the neutral? The line impedances may be combined with
the three load impedances; this effective load is still balanced, and a perfectly
conducting neutral wire could be removed. Thus, if no change is produced in
the system with a short circuit or an open circuit between n and N, any imped-
ance may be inserted in the neutral and the neutral current will remain zero.
It follows that, if we have balanced sources, balanced loads, and bal-
anced line impedances, a neutral wire of any impedance may be replaced
by any other impedance, including a short circuit or an open circuit; the
replacement will not affect the system’s voltages or currents. It is often
helpful to visualize a short circuit between the two neutral points, whether a
neutral wire is actually present or not; the problem is then reduced to three
single-phase problems, all identical except for the consistent difference in
phase angle. We say that we thus work the problem on a “per-phase’’ basis.

SECTION 12.3 THREE-PHASE Y-Y CONNECTION
Since one of the source phase voltages is given and we are told to use
the positive phase sequence, the three phase voltages are:
V an = 200/0 ◦ V
V bn = 200/−120 ◦ V
V cn = 200/−240 ◦ V
√
The line voltage is 200 3 = 346 V; the phase angle of each line volt-
age can be determined by constructing a phasor diagram, as we did in
Fig. 12.13 (as a matter of fact, the phasor diagram of Fig. 12.13 is
applicable), subtracting the phase voltages using a scientific calculator,
or by invoking Eqs. [1] to [3]. We find that V ab is 346/30 ◦ V,
V bc = 346/−90 ◦ V, and V ca = 346/−210 ◦ V.
The line current for phase A is
I a A =

magnitudes, the angles for all three voltages and all three currents could

12.4 A balanced three-phase three-wire system has a Y-connected load.
Each phase contains three loads in parallel: − j100 , 100 , and
50 + j50 . Assume positive phase sequence with V ab = 400/0 ◦ V.
Find (a) V an ; (b) I a A ; (c) the total power drawn by the load.
Ans: 231/−30 ◦ V; 4.62/−30 ◦ A; 3200 W.
Before working another example, this would be a good opportunity to
quickly explore a statement made in Sec. 12.1, i.e., that even though phase
voltages and currents have zero value at specific instants in time (every
1/120 s in North America), the instantaneous power delivered to the total
load is never zero. Consider phase A of Example 12.2 once more, with the
phase voltage and current written in the time domain:
√
v AN = 200 2 cos(120πt + 0 ◦ ) V
and
√
i AN = 2 2 cos(120πt − 60 ◦ ) A
The factor of
2 is required to convert from rms units.468
CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS
Thus, the instantaneous power absorbed by phase A is
p A (t) = v AN i AN = 800 cos(120πt) cos(120πt − 60 ◦ )
= 400[cos(−60 ◦ ) + cos(240πt − 60 ◦ )]
= 200 + 400 cos(240πt − 60 ◦ ) W
in a similar fashion,
p B (t) = 200 + 400 cos(240πt − 300 ◦ ) W
and
p C (t) = 200 + 400 cos(240πt − 180 ◦ ) W
The instantaneous power absorbed by the total load is therefore
p(t) = p A (t) + p B (t) + p C (t) = 600 W
independent of time, and the same value as the average power computed in
Example 12.2.

A balanced three-phase system with a line voltage of 300 V is sup-
plying a balanced Y-connected load with 1200 W at a leading PF
of 0.8. Find the line current and the per-phase load impedance.
√
The phase voltage is 300/ 3 V and the per-phase power is 1200/3 =
400 W. Thus the line current may be found from the power relationship

4 + j2 per phase. Find (a) the phase voltage; (b) the line current;
(c) the total power drawn by the load; (d) the power factor at which
the source is operating.
Ans: 289 V; 97.5 A; 83.0 kW; 0.983 lagging.469
SECTION 12.3 THREE-PHASE Y-Y CONNECTION
EXAMPLE 12.4
A balanced 600 W lighting load is added (in parallel) to the system
of Example 12.3. Determine the new line current.
We first sketch a suitable per-phase circuit, as shown in Fig. 12.17. The
600 W load is assumed to be a balanced load evenly distributed among
the three phases, resulting in an additional 200 W consumed by each
phase.
The amplitude of the lighting current (labeled I 1 ) is determined by
300
200 = √ |I 1 | cos 0 ◦
3
so that
|I 1 | = 1.155 A
In a similar way, the amplitude of the capacitive load current (labeled I 2 )
is found to be unchanged from its previous value, since the voltage
across it has remained the same:
|I 2 | = 2.89 A
If we assume that the phase with which we are working has a phase
voltage with an angle of 0 ◦ , then since cos −1 (0.8) = 36.9 ◦ ,
I 1 = 1.155/0 ◦ A
I 2 = 2.89/+36.9 ◦ A
and the line current is
I L = I 1 + I 2 = 3.87/+26.6 ◦ A
We can check our results by computing the power generated by this
phase of the source
300
P p = √ 3.87 cos(+26.6 ◦ ) = 600 W
3
which agrees with the fact that the individual phase is known to be sup-
plying 200 W to the new lighting load, as well as 400 W to the original
load.

If an unbalanced Y-connected load is present in an otherwise balanced
three-phase system, the circuit may still be analyzed on a per-phase basis if
the neutral wire is present and if it has zero impedance. If either of these
conditions is not met, other methods must be used, such as mesh or nodal
analysis. However, engineers who spend most of their time with unbalanced
three-phase systems will find the use of symmetrical components a great
time saver.
We leave this topic for more advanced texts.

Let us consider a balanced -connected load which consists of an imped-
ance Z p inserted between each pair of lines. With reference to Fig. 12.18, let
us assume known line voltages
V L = |V ab | = |V bc | = |V ca |

of equal amplitude:
I p = |I AB | = |I BC | = |I C A |
The line currents are also equal in amplitude; the symmetry is apparent from
the phasor diagram of Fig. 12.19. We thus have
I L = |I a A | = |I bB | = |I cC |

Let us disregard the source for the moment and consider only the bal-
anced load. If the load is -connected, then the phase voltage and the line
voltage are indistinguishable,
but the line current is larger than the phase
√
current by a factor of 3; with a Y-connected load, however, the phase cur-
rent and the line current refer to the same current,
and the line voltage is
√
greater than the phase voltage by a factor of 3.
EXAMPLE 12.5
Determine the amplitude of the line current in a three-phase system
with a line voltage of 300 V that supplies 1200 W to a -connected
load at a lagging PF of 0.8; then find the phase impedance
Let us again consider a single phase. It draws 400 W, 0.8 lagging PF, at
a 300 V line voltage. Thus,
400 = 300(I p )(0.8)
and
I p = 1.667 A
and the relationship between phase currents and line currents yields
√
I L = 3(1.667) = 2.89 A
Next, the phase angle of the load is cos −1 (0.8) = 36.9 ◦ , and therefore
the impedance in each phase must be

(b) the line current; (c) the total power absorbed by the load.
Ans: 1.158 A; 2.01 A; 693 W.
Again, keep in mind that we are assuming all voltages
and currents are quoted as rms values.472
CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS
EXAMPLE 12.6
Determine the amplitude of the line current in a three-phase
system with a 300 V line voltage that supplies 1200 W to a
Y-connected load at a lagging PF of 0.8. (This is the same circuit
as in Example 12.5, but with a Y-connected load instead.)
√
On a per-phase basis, we now have a phase voltage of 300/ 3 V,
a power of 400 W, and a lagging PF of 0.8. Thus,
300
400 = √ (I p )(0.8)
3
and
I p = 2.89
(and so I L = 2.89 A)
The phase angle of the load is again 36.9 ◦ , and thus the impedance in
each phase of the Y is

300/ 3
/36.9 ◦ = 60/36.9 ◦
Z p =

√
The 3 factor not only relates phase and line quantities but also appears
in a useful expression for the total power drawn by any balanced three-
phase load. If we assume a Y-connected load with a power-factor angle θ ,
the power taken by any phase is
V L
P p = V p I p cos θ = V p I L cos θ = √ I L cos θ
3
and the total power is
√
P = 3P p = 3V L I L cos θ
In a similar way, the power delivered to each phase of a -connected load is
I L
P p = V p I p cos θ = V L I p cos θ = V L √ cos θ
3
giving a total power
√
P = 3P p = 3V L I L cos θ
[4]
Thus Eq. [4] enables us to calculate the total power delivered to a balanced
load from a knowledge of the magnitude of the line voltage, of the line cur-
rent, and of the phase angle of the load impedance (or admittance), regard-
less of whether the load is Y-connected or -connected. The line current in

-Connected Sources
The source may also be connected in a configuration. This is not typical,
however, for a slight unbalance in the source phases can lead to large cur-
rents circulating in the
loop. For example, let us call the three single-
phase sources V ab , V bc , and V cd . Before closing the by connecting d to a,
let us determine the unbalance by measuring the sum V ab + V bc + V ca .
Suppose that the amplitude of the result is only 1 percent of the line voltage.
The circulating current is thus approximately 13 percent of the line voltage
divided by the internal impedance of any source. How large is this impedance
apt to be? It must depend on the current that the source is expected to deliver
with a negligible drop in terminal voltage. If we assume that this maximum
current causes a 1 percent drop in the terminal voltage, then the circulating
current is one-third of the maximum current! This reduces the useful current
capacity of the source and also increases the losses in the system.

Power-Generating Systems
Today, electrical power is generated by a rather wide
variety of techniques. For example, direct conversion of
solar energy into electricity using photovoltaic (solar cell)
technology results in the production of dc power. Despite
representing a very environmentally friendly technology,
however, photovoltaic-based installations are presently
more expensive than other means of producing electric-
ity, and require the use of inverters to convert the dc power
into ac. Other technologies such as wind turbine, geo-
thermal, hydrodynamic, nuclear, and fossil fuel–based
generators are often more economical by comparison. In
these systems, a shaft is rotated through the action of a
prime mover, such as wind on a propeller, or water or
steam on turbine blades (Fig. 12.20).
Once a prime mover has been harnessed to generate
rotational movement of a shaft, there are several means of
converting this mechanical energy into electrical energy.
One example is a synchronous generator (Fig. 12.21).
These machines are composed of two main sections: a
stationary part, called the stator, and a rotating part,
termed the rotor. DC current is supplied to coils of wire
wound about the rotor to generate a magnetic field,
which is rotated through the action of the prime mover.
A set of three-phase voltages is then induced at a sec-
ond set of windings around the stator. Synchronous
generators get their name from the fact that the fre-
quency of the ac voltage produced is synchronized with
the mechanical rotation of the rotor.
The actual demand on a stand-alone generator can
vary greatly as various loads are added or removed, such
as when air conditioning units kick on, lighting is turned
on or off, etc. The voltage output of a generator should
ideally be independent of the load, but this is not the case
in practice. The voltage E A induced in any given stator
phase, often referred to as the internal generated voltage,
has a magnitude given by
E A = K φω
where K is a constant dependent on the way the machine
is constructed, φ is the magnetic flux produced by the
field windings on the rotor (and hence is independent of
the load), and ω is the speed of rotation, which depends
only on the prime mover and not the load attached to the
generator. Thus, changing the load does not affect the
magnitude of E A . The internal generated voltage can
be related to the phase voltage V φ and the phase current
I A by
E A = V φ + j X S I A
where X S is the synchronous reactance of the generator.

If the load is increased, then a larger current I A will be
drawn from the generator. If the power factor is not
changed (i.e., the angle between V φ and I A remains con-
stant), V φ will be reduced since E A cannot change.
For example, consider the phasor diagram of
Fig. 12.22a, which depicts the voltage-current output of
a single phase of a generator connected to a load with a
lagging power factor of cos θ . The internal generated
voltage E A is also shown. If an additional load is added
without changing the power factor, as represented in
Fig. 12.22b, the supplied current I A increases to I A .
However, the magnitude of the internal generated volt-
age, formed by the sum of the phasors j X S I A and V φ ,
must remain unchanged. Thus, E A = E A , and so the
voltage output (V φ ) of the generator will be slightly
reduced, as depicted in Fig. 12.22b.
■ FIGURE 12.22 Phasor diagrams describing the effect of loading on a
stand-alone synchronous generator. (a) Generator connected to a load having
a lagging power factor of cos θ . (b) An additional load is added without
changing the power factor. The magnitude of the internal generated voltage
E A remains the same while the output current increases. Consequently, the
output voltage V φ is reduced.
The voltage regulation of a generator is defined as
% regulation =
V no load − V full load
× 100
V full load
Ideally, the regulation should be as close to zero as pos-
sible, but this can only be accomplished if the dc current
used to control the flux φ around the field winding is var-
ied in order to compensate for changing load conditions;
this can quickly become rather cumbersome. Thus, when
designing a power generation facility several smaller
generators connected in parallel are usually preferable to
one large generator capable of handling the peak load.
Each generator can be operated at or near full load, so
that the voltage output is essentially constant; individual
generators can be added or removed from the system
depending on the demand.476
CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS
We should also note that balanced three-phase sources may be trans-
formed from Y to , or vice versa, without affecting the load currents or
voltages. The necessary relationships between the line and phase voltages
are shown in Fig. 12.13 for the case where V an has a reference phase angle
of 0 ◦ . This transformation enables us to use whichever source connection
we prefer, and all the load relationships will be correct. Of course, we can-
not specify any currents or voltages within the source until we know how it
is actually connected. Balanced three-phase loads may be transformed
between Y- and -connected configurations using the relation

POWER MEASUREMENT IN
• THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
Use of the Wattmeter
In large electrical systems, not only are voltage and current important to
know, but power is quoted so often that measuring it directly proves highly
valuable. This is typically performed using a device known as a wattmeter,
which must have the ability to establish both the voltage and the current
associated with either the source, the load, or both. Modern devices are very
similar to the digital multimeter, providing a numerical display of the quan-
tity being measured. These devices frequently make use of the fact that
current gives rise to a magnetic field, which can be measured without break-
ing the circuit. However, in the field we still encounter analog versions of
the multimeter, and they continue to have some advantages over digital
versions, such as the ability to function without a separate power source
(e.g., battery), and secondary information that comes from watching a
needle move as opposed to numbers seemingly jumping around randomly
on a display. Thus, in this section, we focus on power measurement using a
traditional analog meter, as switching to a digital device is straightforward if
one is available. Before embarking on a discussion of the specialized tech-
niques used to measure power in three-phase systems, it is to our advantage
to briefly consider how a wattmeter is used in a single-phase circuit.
Power measurement is most often accomplished at frequencies below a
few hundred hertz through the use of a wattmeter that contains two separate
coils. One of these coils is made of heavy wire, having a very low resis-
tance, and is called the current coil; the second coil is composed of a much
greater number of turns of fine wire, with relatively high resistance, and is
termed the potential coil, or voltage coil. Additional resistance may also be
inserted internally or externally in series with the potential coil. The torque
applied to the moving system and the pointer is proportional to the instanta-
neous product of the currents flowing in the two coils. The mechanical iner-
tia of the moving system, however, causes a deflection that is proportional
to the average value of this torque.
The wattmeter is used by connecting it into a network in such a way that
the current flowing in the current coil is the current flowing into the networkSECTION 12.5 POWER MEASUREMENT IN THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS

and the voltage across the potential coil is the voltage across the two terminals
of the network. The current in the potential coil is thus the input voltage di-
vided by the resistance of the potential coil.
It is apparent that the wattmeter has four available terminals, and correct
connections must be made to these terminals in order to obtain an upscale
reading on the meter. To be specific, let us assume that we are measuring the
power absorbed by a passive network. The current coil is inserted in series
with one of the two conductors connected to the load, and the potential coil
is installed between the two conductors, usually on the “load side’’ of the
current coil. The potential coil terminals are often indicated by arrows, as
shown in Fig. 12.23a. Each coil has two terminals, and the proper relation-
ship between the sense of the current and voltage must be observed. One
end of each coil is usually marked (+), and an upscale reading is obtained
if a positive current is flowing into the (+) end of the current coil while the
(+) terminal of the potential coil is positive with respect to the unmarked
end. The wattmeter shown in the network of Fig. 12.23a therefore gives an
upscale deflection when the network to the right is absorbing power. A re-
versal of either coil, but not both, will cause the meter to try to deflect down-
scale; a reversal of both coils will never affect the reading.
As an example of the use of such a wattmeter in measuring average
power, let us consider the circuit shown in Fig. 12.23b. The connection of
the wattmeter is such that an upscale reading corresponds to a positive ab-
sorbed power for the network to the right of the meter, that is, the right
source. The power absorbed by this source is given by
P = |V 2 | |I| cos(ang V 2 − ang I)
477CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS
Using superposition or mesh analysis, we find the current is
I = 11.18/153.4 ◦ A
and thus the absorbed power is
P = (100)(11.18) cos(0 ◦ − 153.4 ◦ ) = −1000 W
The pointer therefore rests against the downscale stop. In practice, the
potential coil can be reversed more quickly than the current coil, and this
reversal provides an upscale reading of 1000 W.

The Wattmeter in a Three-Phase System
At first glance, measurement of the power drawn by a three-phase load
seems to be a simple problem. We need place only one wattmeter in each of
the three phases and add the results. For example, the proper connections
for a Y-connected load are shown in Fig. 12.25a. Each wattmeter has its cur-
rent coil inserted in one phase of the load and its potential coil connected
between the line side of that load and the neutral. In a similar way, three
wattmeters may be connected as shown in Fig. 12.25b to measure the total
power taken by a -connected load. The methods are theoretically correct,
but they may be useless in practice because the neutral of the Y is not al-
ways accessible and the phases of the are not available. A three-phase ro-
tating machine, for example, has only three accessible terminals, those
which we have been calling A, B, and C.
Clearly, we have a need for a method of measuring the total power
drawn by a three-phase load having only three accessible terminals; mea-
surements may be made on the “line’’ side of these terminals, but not on
the “load’’ side. Such a method is available, and is capable of measuring the
power taken by an unbalanced load from an unbalanced source. Let us479

connect three wattmeters in such a way that each has its current coil in one
line and its voltage coil between that line and some common point x, as
shown in Fig. 12.26. Although a system with a Y-connected load is illus-
trated, the arguments we present are equally valid for a -connected load.
The point x may be some unspecified point in the three-phase system, or it
may be merely a point in space at which the three potential coils have a
common node. The average power indicated by wattmeter A must be

where T is the period of all the source voltages. The readings of the other
two wattmeters are given by similar expressions, and the total average

Reference to the circuit diagram shows that this sum is indeed the sum of
the average powers taken by each phase of the load, and the sum of the read-
ings of the three wattmeters therefore represents the total average power
drawn by the entire load!
Let us illustrate this procedure with a numerical example before we dis-
cover that one of these three wattmeters is really superfluous. We will as-
sume a balanced source,
V ab = 100/0 ◦ V
V bc = 100/−120 ◦ V

and an unbalanced load,

SECTION 12.5 POWER MEASUREMENT IN THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS
Let us assume ideal wattmeters, connected as illustrated in Fig. 12.26, with
point x located on the neutral of the source n. The three line currents may be
obtained by mesh analysis,
I a A = 19.32/15 ◦ A
I bB = 19.32/165 ◦ A
I cC = 10/−90 ◦ A
The voltage between the neutrals is
V n N = V nb + V B N = V nb + I bB ( j10) = 157.7/−90 ◦

or a total power of 1 kW. Since an rms current of 10 A flows through the
resistive load, the total power drawn by the load is
P = 10 2 (10) = 1 kW
and the two methods agree.
The Two-Wattmeter Method
We have proved that point x, the common connection of the three potential
coils, may be located any place we wish without affecting the algebraic sum
of the three wattmeter readings. Let us now consider the effect of placing
point x, this common connection of the three wattmeters, directly on one of
the lines. If, for example, one end of each potential coil is returned to B, then
there is no voltage across the potential coil of wattmeter B and this meter
must read zero. It may therefore be removed, and the algebraic sum of the
remaining two wattmeter readings is still the total power drawn by the load.
When the location of x is selected in this way, we describe the method of
power measurement as the two-wattmeter method. The sum of the readings
indicates the total power, regardless of (1) load unbalance, (2) source un-
balance, (3) differences in the two wattmeters, and (4) the waveform of the
periodic source. The only assumption we have made is that wattmeter cor-
rections are sufficiently small that we can ignore them. In Fig. 12.26, for
example, the current coil of each meter has passing through it the line
current drawn by the load plus the current taken by the potential coil. Since
the latter current is usually quite small, its effect may be estimated from a
knowledge of the resistance of the potential coil and voltage across it. These
two quantities enable a close estimate to be made of the power dissipated in
the potential coil.
In the numerical example described previously, let us now assume that
two wattmeters are used, one with current coil in line A and potential coil
between lines A and B, the other with current coil in line C and potential coil
Note that the reading of one of the wattmeters is
negative. Our previous discussion on the basic use of
a wattmeter indicates that an upscale reading on that
meter can only be obtained after either the potential
coil or the current coil is reversed.CHAPTER 12 POLYPHASE CIRCUITS

between C and B. The first meter reads
P 1 = V AB I a A cos(ang V AB − ang I a A )
= 100(19.32) cos(0 ◦ − 15 ◦ )
= 1866 W
and the second
P 2 = V CB I cC cos(ang V CB − ang I cC )
= 100(10) cos(60 ◦ + 90 ◦ )
= −866 W
and, therefore,
P = P 1 + P 2 = 1866 − 866 = 1000 W
as we expect from recent experience with the circuit.
In the case of a balanced load, the two-wattmeter method enables the PF
angle to be determined, as well as the total power drawn by the load. Let us
assume a load impedance with a phase angle θ ; either a Y or connection
may be used and we will assume the connection shown in Fig. 12.27. The
construction of a standard phasor diagram, such as that of Fig. 12.19, en-
ables us to determine the proper phase angle between the several line volt-
ages and line currents. We therefore determine the readings
P 1 = |V AB | |I a A | cos(ang V AB − ang I a A )
= V L I L cos(30 ◦ + θ)
and
P 2 = |V C B | |I cC | cos(ang V C B − ang I cC )
= V L I L cos(30 ◦ − θ)
The ratio of the two readings is
cos(30 ◦ + θ)
P 1

If we expand the cosine terms, this equation is easily solved for tan θ ,

[6]
P 2 + P 1SECTION 12.5 POWER MEASUREMENT IN THREE-PHASE SYSTEMS

Thus, equal wattmeter readings indicate a unity PF load; equal and op-
posite readings indicate a purely reactive load; a reading of P 2 which is
(algebraically) greater than P 1 indicates an inductive impedance; and a
reading of P 2 which is less than P 1 signifies a capacitive load. How can we
tell which wattmeter reads P 1 and which reads P 2 ? It is true that P 1 is in line
A, and P 2 is in line C, and our positive phase-sequence system forces V an to
lag V cn . This is enough information to differentiate between two watt-
meters, but it is confusing to apply in practice. Even if we were unable to
distinguish between the two, we know the magnitude of the phase angle, but
not its sign. This is often sufficient information; if the load is an induction
motor, the angle must be positive and we do not need to make any tests to
determine which reading is which. If no previous knowledge of the load is
assumed, then there are several methods of resolving the ambiguity. Perhaps
the simplest method is that which involves adding a high-impedance reac-
tive load, say, a three-phase capacitor, across the unknown load. The load
must become more capacitive. Thus, if the magnitude of tan θ (or the mag-
nitude of θ ) decreases, then the load was inductive, whereas an increase in
the magnitude of tan θ signifies an original capacitive impedance.

system having V ab = 230/0 ◦ V rms and positive phase sequence.

pegged at downscale, one of the coils would need
to be reversed in order to take the reading.

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
Polyphase circuits are not encountered directly by everyone, but are part of
almost every large building installation. In this chapter we studied how three
voltages, each 120 ◦ out of phase with the others, can be supplied by a single
generator (and hence have the same frequency) and connected to a three-
component load. For the sake of convenience we introduced the double-
subscript notation, which is commonly employed. A three-phase system will
have at least three terminals; a neutral wire connection is not mandatory but
is common at least for the source. If a -connected load is employed, then
there is no neutral connection to it. When a neutral wire is present, we can
define phase voltages V an , V bn , and V cn between each phase (a, b, or c) and
neutral. Kirchhoff’s voltage law requires that these three phase voltages sum
to zero, regardless of whether positive or negative phase sequence relates
their angles. Line voltages (i.e., between phases) can be related directly to the
phase voltages; for a -connected load they are equal. In a similar fashion,
line currents and phase currents can be directly related to one another; in a
Y-connected load, they are equal. At first glance such systems can appear
to be somewhat complicated, but symmetry often allows us to perform the
analysis on a per-phase basis, simplifying our calculations considerably.SUMMARY AND REVIEW
A concise list of key concepts of the chapter is presented below for the
convenience of the reader, along with the corresponding example numbers.
❑ The majority of electricity production is in the form of three-phase
power.
❑ Most residential electricity in North America is in the form of single-
phase alternating current at a frequency of 60 Hz and an rms voltage of
115 V. Elsewhere, 50 Hz at 240 V rms is most common.
❑ Double-subscript notation is commonly employed in power systems
for both voltages and currents. (Example 12.1)
❑ Three-phase sources can be either Y- or -connected. Both types of
sources have three terminals, one for each phase; Y-connected sources
have a neutral connection as well. (Example 12.2)
❑ In a balanced three-phase system, each phase voltage has the same
magnitude, but is 120 ◦ out of phase with the other two. (Example 12.2)
❑ Loads in a three-phase system may be either Y- or -connected.
❑ In a balanced Y-connected source with positive (“abc’’) phase
sequence, the line voltages are

In a system with a Y-connected load, the line currents are equal to the
phase currents. (Examples 12.3, 12.4, 12.6)
In a -connected load, the line voltages are equal to the phase voltages.

Most power calculations are performed on a per-phase basis, assuming
a balanced system; otherwise, nodal/mesh analysis is always a valid
approach. (Examples 12.3, 12.4, 12.5)
The power in a three-phase system (balanced or unbalanced) can be
measured with only two wattmeters. (Example 12.7)
The instantaneous power in any balanced three-phase system is constant.

KEY CONCEPTS
Mutual Inductance
INTRODUCTION
Whenever current flows through a conductor, whether as ac or
dc, a magnetic field is generated about that conductor. In the
context of circuits, we often refer to the magnetic flux through a
loop of wire. This is the average normal component of the mag-
netic field density emanating from the loop multiplied by the
surface area of the loop. When a time-varying magnetic field
generated by one loop penetrates a second loop, a voltage is
induced between the ends of the second wire. In order to distin-
guish this phenomenon from the “inductance’’ we defined
earlier, more properly termed “self-inductance,’’ we will define a
new term, mutual inductance.
There is no such device as a “mutual inductor,’’ but the
principle forms the basis for an extremely important device—the
transformer. A transformer consists of two coils of wire separated
by a small distance, and is commonly used to convert ac voltages
to higher or lower values depending on the application. Every
electrical appliance that requires dc current to operate but plugs
into an ac wall outlet makes use of a transformer to adjust voltage
levels prior to rectification a function typically performed by
diodes and described in every introductory electronics text.

CHAPTER 13 MAGNETICALLY COUPLED CIRCUITS
where the passive sign convention is assumed. The physical basis for such
a current-voltage characteristic rests upon two things:
1. The production of a magnetic flu by a current, the flux being
proportional to the current in linear inductors.
2. The production of a voltage by the time-varying magnetic field, the
voltage being proportional to the time rate of change of the magnetic
field or the magnetic flux.
Coefficient of Mutual Inductance
Mutual inductance results from a slight extension of this same argument. A
current flowing in one coil establishes a magnetic flux about that coil and also
about a second coil nearby. The time-varying flux surrounding the second coil
produces a voltage across the terminals of the second coil; this voltage is pro-
portional to the time rate of change of the current flowing through the first coil.
Figure 13.1a shows a simple model of two coils L 1 and L 2 , sufficiently close
together that the flux produced by a current i 1 (t) flowing through L 1 establishes
an open-circuit voltage v 2 (t) across the terminals of L 2 . Without considering
the proper algebraic sign for the relationship at this point, we define the coef-
ficien of mutual inductance, or simply mutual inductance, M 21 , as
v 2 (t) = M 21

■ FIGURE 13.1 (a) A current i 1 through L 1 produces an open-circuit voltage v 2
across L 2 . (b) A current i 2 through L 2 produces an open-circuit voltage v 1 across L 1 .
The order of the subscripts on M 21 indicates that a voltage response is pro-
duced at L 2 by a current source at L 1 . If the system is reversed, as indicated
in Fig. 13.1b, then we have
v 1 (t) = M 12
di 2 (t)
dt
[2]
Two coefficients of mutual inductance are not necessary, however; we
will use energy relationships a little later to prove that M 12 and M 21 are
equal. Thus, M 12 = M 21 = M. The existence of mutual coupling between
two coils is indicated by a double-headed arrow, as shown in Fig. 13.1a and b.
Mutual inductance is measured in henrys and, like resistance, induc-
tance, and capacitance, is a positive quantity. 1 The voltage M di/dt,
however, may appear as either a positive or a negative quantity depending on
whether the current is increasing or decreasing at a particular instant in time.
(1) Mutual inductance is not universally assumed to be positive. It is particularly convenient to allow it to
“carry its own sign’’ when three or more coils are involved and each coil interacts with each other coil. We
will restrict our attention to the more important simple case of two coils.495
SECTION 13.1 MUTUAL INDUCTANCE
i 1
Dot Convention
The inductor is a two-terminal element, and we are able to use the passive
sign convention in order to select the correct sign for the voltage L di/dt or
jωLI. If the current enters the terminal at which the positive voltage
reference is located, then the positive sign is used. Mutual inductance,
however, cannot be treated in exactly the same way because four terminals
are involved. The choice of a correct sign is established by use of one of sev-
eral possibilities that include the “dot convention,” or by an examination of
the particular way in which each coil is wound. We will use the dot conven-
tion and merely look briefly at the physical construction of the coils; the use
of other special symbols is not necessary when only two coils are coupled.
The dot convention makes use of a large dot placed at one end of each
of the two coils which are mutually coupled. We determine the sign of the
mutual voltage as follows:

Thus, in Fig. 13.2a, i 1 enters the dotted terminal of L 1 , v 2 is sensed posi-
tively at the dotted terminal of L 2 , and v 2 = M di 1 /dt . We have found pre-
viously that it is often not possible to select voltages or currents throughout
a circuit so that the passive sign convention is everywhere satisfied; the
same situation arises with mutual coupling. For example, it may be more
convenient to represent v 2 by a positive voltage reference at the undotted
terminal, as shown in Fig. 13.2b; then v 2 = −M di 1 /dt . Currents that enter
the dotted terminal are also not always available, as indicated by Fig. 13.2c
and d. We note then that:

A current entering the undotted terminal of one coil provides a voltage
that is positively sensed at the undotted terminal of the second coil.
Note that the preceding discussion does not include any contribution to the
voltage from self-induction, which would occur if i 2 were nonzero. We will
consider this important situation in detail, but a quick example first is
appropriate.
■ FIGURE 13.2 Current entering the dotted terminal
of one coil produces a voltage that is sensed positively
at the dotted terminal of the second coil. Current
entering the undotted terminal of one coil produces a
voltage that is sensed positively at the undotted
terminal of the second coil.

For the circuit shown in Fig. 13.3, (a) determine v 1 if i 2 = 5 sin 45t A
and i 1 = 0; (b) determine v 2 if i 1 = −8e −t A and i 2 = 0.
(a) Since the current i 2 is entering the undotted terminal of the right
coil, the positive reference for the voltage induced across the left coil is
the undotted terminal. Thus, we have an open-circuit voltage
v 1 = −(2)(45)(5 cos 45t) = −450 cos 45t
V
appearing across the terminals of the left coil as a result of the
time-varying magnetic flux generated by i 2 flowing into the right coil.

■ FIGURE 13.4 Since the pairs v 1 , i 1 and v 2 , i 2 each
satisfy the passive sign convention, the voltages of
self-induction are both positive; since i 1 and i 2 each
enter dotted terminals, and since v 1 and v 2 are both
positively sensed at the dotted terminals, the voltages
of mutual induction are also both positive.
So far, we have considered only a mutual voltage present across an open-
circuited coil. In general, a nonzero current will be flowing in each of the
two coils, and a mutual voltage will be produced in each coil because of the
current flowing in the other coil. This mutual voltage is present indepen-
dently of and in addition to any voltage of self-induction. In other words, the
voltage across the terminals of L 1 will be composed of two terms, L 1 di 1 /dt
and M di 2 /dt , each carrying a sign depending on the current directions, the
assumed voltage sense, and the placement of the two dots. In the portion of
a circuit drawn in Fig. 13.4, currents i 1 and i 2 are shown, each entering a
dotted terminal. The voltage across L 1 is thus composed of two parts,

the dotted terminal, the mutual term of v 2 is positive;
and since i 2 enters the undotted terminal and v 1 is
positively sensed at the undotted terminal, the mutual
term of v 1 is also positive.

In Fig. 13.5 the currents and voltages are not selected with the object of
obtaining all positive terms for v 1 and v 2 . By inspecting only the reference
symbols for i 1 and v 1 , it is apparent that the passive sign convention is not
satisfied and the sign of L 1 di 1 /dt must therefore be negative. An identical
conclusion is reached for the term L 2 di 2 /dt . The mutual term of v 2 is
signed by inspecting the direction of i 1 and v 2 ; since i 1 enters the dotted
terminal and v 2 is sensed positive at the dotted terminal, the sign of
M di 1 /dt must be positive. Finally, i 2 enters the undotted terminal of L 2 ,
and v 1 is sensed positive at the undotted terminal of L 1 ; hence, the mutual
portion of v 1 , M di 2 /dt , must also be positive. Thus, we have

SECTION 13.1 MUTUAL INDUCTANCE
Physical Basis of the Dot Convention
We can gain a more complete understanding of the dot symbolism by looking
at the physical basis for the convention; the meaning of the dots is now inter-
preted in terms of magnetic flu . Two coils are shown wound on a cylindrical
form in Fig. 13.6, and the direction of each winding is evident. Let us assume
that the current i 1 is positive and increasing with time. The magnetic flux that
i 1 produces within the form has a direction which may be found by the right-
hand rule: when the right hand is wrapped around the coil with the fingers
pointing in the direction of current flow, the thumb indicates the direction of
the flux within the coil. Thus i 1 produces a flux which is directed downward;
since i 1 is increasing with time, the flux, which is proportional to i 1 , is also
increasing with time. Turning now to the second coil, let us also think of i 2 as
positive and increasing; the application of the right-hand rule shows that i 2
also produces a magnetic flux which is directed downward and is increasing.
In other words, the assumed currents i 1 and i 2 produce additive fluxes.
The voltage across the terminals of any coil results from the time rate of
change of the flux within that coil. The voltage across the terminals of the first
coil is therefore greater with i 2 flowing than it would be if i 2 were zero; i 2 in-
duces a voltage in the first coil which has the same sense as the self-induced
voltage in that coil. The sign of the self-induced voltage is known from the
passive sign convention, and the sign of the mutual voltage is thus obtained.
The dot convention enables us to suppress the physical construction of the
coils by placing a dot at one terminal of each coil such that currents entering
dot-marked terminals produce additive fluxes. It is apparent that there are
always two possible locations for the dots, because both dots may always
be moved to the other ends of the coils and additive fluxes will still result.

■ FIGURE 13.6 The physical construction of two
mutually coupled coils. From a consideration of the
direction of magnetic flux produced by each coil, it
is shown that dots may be placed either on the
upper terminal of each coil or on the lower terminal
of each coil.

᭤ Devise a plan.
Mesh analysis is likely to be a good approach, as we have a circuit
with two clearly defined meshes. Once we find I 2 , V 2 is simply 400I 2 .
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.
In the left mesh, the sign of the mutual term is determined by
applying the dot convention. Since I 2 enters the undotted terminal of
L 2 , the mutual voltage across L 1 must have the positive reference at
the undotted terminal. Thus,
(1 + j10)I 1 − j90I 2 = 10/0 ◦
Since I 1 enters the dot-marked terminal, the mutual term in the right
mesh has its (+) reference at the dotted terminal of the 100 H induc-
tor. Therefore, we may write
(400 + j1000)I 2 − j90I 1 = 0
᭤ Determine if additional information is required.
We have two equations in two unknowns, I 1 and I 2 . Once we solve
for the two currents, the output voltage V 2 may be obtained by
multiplying I 2 by 400 .
᭤ Attempt a solution.
Upon solving these two equations with a scientific calculator, we find
that
I 2 = 0.172/−16.70 ◦ A
Thus,
400(0.172/−16.70 ◦ )
V 2
=
V 1
10/0 ◦
= 6.880/−16.70 ◦
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
We note that the output voltage V 2 is actually larger in magnitude
than the input voltage V 1 . Should we always expect this result? The
answer is no. As we will see in later sections, the transformer can be
constructed to achieve either a reduction or an increase in the voltage.
We can perform a quick estimate, however, and at least find an upper
and lower bound for our answer. If the 400 resistor is replaced with
a short circuit, V 2 = 0. If instead we replace the 400 resistor with
an open circuit, I 2 = 0 and hence
V 1 = (1 + jωL 1 )I 1
and
V 2 = jωMI 1
Solving, we find that the maximum value we could expect for
V 2 /V 1 is 8.955/5.711 ◦ . Thus, our answer at least appears
reasonable.SECTION 13.1 MUTUAL INDUCTANCE
The output voltage of the circuit in Fig. 13.7a is greater in magnitude
than the input voltage, so that a voltage gain is possible with this type of
circuit. It is also interesting to consider this voltage ratio as a function of ω.
To find I 2 ( jω) for this particular circuit, we write the mesh equations in
terms of an unspecified angular frequency ω:
− jω9I 2 = 10/0 ◦
(1 + jω)I 1
and
− jω9I 1 + (400 + jω100)I 2 = 0
Solving by substitution, we find that
I 2 =
j90ω
400 + j500ω − 19ω 2
Thus, we obtain the ratio of output voltage to input voltage as a function of
frequency ω

7 near a frequency of 4.6 rad/s. However, for very small or very large fre-
quencies, the magnitude of the transfer function is less than unity.
The circuit is still passive, except for the voltage source, and the voltage
gain must not be mistakenly interpreted as a power gain. At ω = 10 rad/s,
the voltage gain is 6.88, but the ideal voltage source, having a terminal volt-
age of 10 V, delivers a total power of 8.07 W, of which only 5.94 W reaches
the 400 resistor. The ratio of the output power to the source power, which
we may define as the power gain, is thus 0.736.

Once again, our first step is to replace both the mutual inductance and
the two self-inductances with their corresponding impedances as shown
in Fig. 13.10b. Applying Kirchhoff’s voltage law to the first mesh, a
positive sign for the mutual term is ensured by selecting (I 3 − I 2 ) as the
current through the second coil. Thus,

or

ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
Let us now consider the energy stored in a pair of mutually coupled induc-
tors. The results will be useful in several different ways. We will first justify
our assumption that M 12 = M 21 , and we may then determine the maximum
possible value of the mutual inductance between two given inductors.

The pair of coupled coils shown in Fig. 13.12 has currents, voltages, and po-
larity dots indicated. In order to show that M 12 = M 21 we begin by letting
all currents and voltages be zero, thus establishing zero initial energy stor-
age in the network. We then open-circuit the right-hand terminal pair and in-
crease i 1 from zero to some constant (dc) value I 1 at time t = t 1 . The power
entering the network from the left at any instant is
■ FIGURE 13.12 A pair of coupled coils with a

and the power entering from the right is
v 2 i 2 = 0
since i 2 = 0.

We now hold i 1 constant (i 1 = I 1 ), and we let i 2 change from zero at t = t 1
to some constant value I 2 at t = t 2 . The energy delivered from the right-
hand source is thus
t 2

However, even though the value of i 1 remains constant, the left-hand source
also delivers energy to the network during this time interval:

The total energy stored in the network when both i 1 and i 2 have reached
constant values is
W total = 12 L 1 I 1 2 + 12 L 2 I 2 2 + M 12 I 1 I 2
Now, we may establish the same final currents in this network by allow-
ing the currents to reach their final values in the reverse order, that is, first
increasing i 2 from zero to I 2 and then holding i 2 constant while i 1 increases
from zero to I 1 . If the total energy stored is calculated for this experiment,
the result is found to be
W total = 12 L 1 I 1 2 + 12 L 2 I 2 2 + M 21 I 1 I 2
The only difference is the interchange of the mutual inductances M 21 and
M 12 . The initial and final conditions in the network are the same, however,
and so the two values of the stored energy must be identical. Thus,
M 12 = M 21 = M
and
W = 12 L 1 I 1 2 + 12 L 2 I 2 2 + M I 1 I 2
[6]SECTION 13.2 ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS
If one current enters a dot-marked terminal while the other leaves a dot-
marked terminal, the sign of the mutual energy term is reversed:
W = 12 L 1 I 1 2 + 12 L 2 I 2 2 − MI 1 I 2
[7]
Although Eqs. [6] and [7] were derived by treating the final values of the
two currents as constants, these “constants’’ can have any value, and the
energy expressions correctly represent the energy stored when the instanta-
neous values of i 1 and i 2 are I 1 and I 2 , respectively. In other words, lower-
case symbols might just as well be used:
w(t) = 12 L 1 [i 1 (t)] 2 + 12 L 2 [i 2 (t)] 2 ± M [i 1 (t)] [i 2 (t)]
[8]
The only assumption upon which Eq. [8] is based is the logical establish-
ment of a zero-energy reference level when both currents are zero.
Establishing an Upper Limit for M
Equation [8] may now be used to establish an upper limit for the value of M.
Since w(t) represents the energy stored within a passive network, it cannot
be negative for any values of i 1 , i 2 , L 1 , L 2 , or M. Let us assume first that i 1
and i 2 are either both positive or both negative; their product is therefore
positive. From Eq. [8], the only case in which the energy could possibly be
negative is
w = 12 L 1 i 1 2 + 12 L 2 i 2 2 − Mi 1 i 2
which we may write, by completing the square, as
√
√
√
2
w = 12
L 1 i 1 − L 2 i 2 + L 1 L 2 i 1 i 2 − Mi 1 i 2
Since in reality the energy cannot be negative, the right-hand side of this
equation cannot be negative. The first term, however, may be as small as
zero, so we have the restriction that the sum of the last two terms cannot be
negative. Hence,
L 1 L 2 ≥ M
or
M ≤
L 1 L 2
[9]
There is, therefore, an upper limit to the possible magnitude of the mutual
inductance; it can be no larger than the geometric mean of the inductances
of the two coils between which the mutual inductance exists. Although we
have derived this inequality on the assumption that i 1 and i 2 carried the same
algebraic sign, a similar development is possible if the signs are opposite; it
is necessary only to select the positive sign in Eq. [8].
We might also have demonstrated the truth of inequality [9] from a
physical consideration of the magnetic coupling; if we think of i 2 as being
zero and the current i 1 as establishing the magnetic flux linking both L 1 and
L 2 , it is apparent that the flux within L 2 cannot be greater than the flux within
L 1 , which represents the total flux. Qualitatively, then, there is an upper
limit to the magnitude of the mutual inductance possible between two given
inductors.

coupling coefficient defined as
Since M ≤

[10]
0 ≤ k ≤ 1
The larger values of the coefficient of coupling are obtained with coils
which are physically closer, which are wound or oriented to provide a larger
common magnetic flux, or which are provided with a common path through
a material which serves to concentrate and localize the magnetic flux
(a high-permeability material). Coils having a coefficient of coupling close
to unity are said to be tightly coupled.
EXAMPLE 13.4
In Fig. 13.13, let L 1 = 0.4 H, L 2 = 2.5 H, k = 0.6, and i 1 = 4i 2 =

To evaluate this quantity, we require a value for M. This is obtained

Thus, v 1 (0) = 0.4[−10 sin(−20 ◦ )] + 0.6[−2.5 sin(−20 ◦ )] = 1.881V.
The total energy is found by summing the energy stored in each in-
ductor, which has three separate components since the two coils are
known to be magnetically coupled. Since both currents enter a “dotted’’
terminal,

THE LINEAR TRANSFORMER
We are now ready to apply our knowledge of magnetic coupling to the
description of two specific practical devices, each of which may be repre-
sented by a model containing mutual inductance. Both of the devices are
transformers, a term which we define as a network containing two or more
coils which are deliberately coupled magnetically (Fig. 13.15). In this sec-
tion we consider the linear transformer, which happens to be an excellent
model for devices used at radio frequencies, or higher frequencies. In
Sec. 13.4 we will consider the ideal transformer, which is an idealized
unity-coupled model of a physical transformer that has a core made of some
magnetic material, usually an iron alloy.
■ FIGURE 13.15 A selection of small transformers for use in electronic applications;
the AA battery is shown for scale only.
In Fig. 13.16 a transformer is shown with two mesh currents identified.
The first mesh, usually containing the source, is called the primary, while the
second mesh, usually containing the load, is known as the secondary. The
inductors labeled L 1 and L 2 are also referred to as the primary and secondary,
respectively, of the transformer. We will assume that the transformer is
linear. This implies that no magnetic material (which may cause a nonlin-
ear flux-versus-current relationship) is employed. Without such material,
however, it is difficult to achieve a coupling coefficient greater than a few
tenths. The two resistors serve to account for the resistance of the wire out
of which the primary and secondary coils are wound, and any other losses.

We may simplify by defining
Z 11 = R 1 + jωL 1

and
so that

[15]
Before manipulating this expression any further, we can draw several
exciting conclusions. In the first place, this result is independent of the lo-
cation of the dots on either winding, for if either dot is moved to the other
end of the coil, the result is a change in sign of each term involving M in
Eqs. [11] to [14]. This same effect could be obtained by replacing M by
(−M), and such a change cannot affect the input impedance, as Eq. [15]
demonstrates. We also may note in Eq. [15] that the input impedance is sim-
ply Z 11 if the coupling is reduced to zero. As the coupling is increased from
zero, the input impedance differs from Z 11 by an amount ω 2 M 2 /Z 22 ,
termed the reflected impedance. The nature of this change is more evident
if we expand this expression
Z in = Z 11 +

Since ω 2 M 2 R 22 /(R 22
presence of the secondary increases the losses in the primary circuit. In
other words, the presence of the secondary might be accounted for in the
primary circuit by increasing the value of R 1 . Moreover, the reactance
which the secondary reflects into the primary circuit has a sign which is
opposite to that of X 22 , the net reactance around the secondary loop. This
reactance X 22 is the sum of ωL 2 and X L ; it is necessarily positive for induc-
tive loads and either positive or negative for capacitive loads, depending on
the magnitude of the load reactance.

SECTION 13.3 THE LINEAR TRANSFORMER
T and
Equivalent Networks
It is often convenient to replace a transformer with an equivalent network in
the form of a T or . If we separate the primary and secondary resistances
from the transformer, only the pair of mutually coupled inductors remains,
as shown in Fig. 13.17. Note that the two lower terminals of the transformer
are connected together to form a three-terminal network. We do this
because both of our equivalent networks are also three-terminal networks.

The form of these two equations is familiar and may be easily inter-
preted in terms of mesh analysis. Let us select a clockwise i 1 and a counter-
clockwise i 2 so that i 1 and i 2 are exactly identifiable with the currents in
Fig. 13.17. The terms M di 2 /dt in Eq. [16] and M di 1 /dt in Eq. [17] indi-
cate that the two meshes must then have a common self-inductance M.
Since the total inductance around the left-hand mesh is L 1 , a self-inductance
of L 1 − M must be inserted in the first mesh, but not in the second mesh.
Similarly, a self-inductance of L 2 − M is required in the second mesh, but
not in the first mesh. The resultant equivalent network is shown in
Fig. 13.18. The equivalence is guaranteed by the identical pairs of equations
relating v 1 , i 1 , v 2 , and i 2 for the two networks.

■ FIGURE 13.18 The T equivalent of the transformer shown in Fig. 13.17.
If either of the dots on the windings of the given transformer is placed
on the opposite end of its coil, the sign of the mutual terms in Eqs. [16] and
[17] will be negative. This is analogous to replacing M with −M, and such
a replacement in the network of Fig. 13.18 leads to the correct equivalent
for this case. (The three self-inductance values would then be L 1 + M ,
−M, and L 2 + M .)
The inductances in the T equivalent are all self-inductances; no mutual
inductance is present. It is possible that negative values of inductance may
be obtained for the equivalent circuit, but this is immaterial if our only de-
sire is a mathematical analysis. There are times when procedures for syn-
thesizing networks to provide a desired transfer function lead to circuits
containing a T network having a negative inductance; this network may
then be realized by use of an appropriate linear transformer.

Equations [18] and [19] may be interpreted as a pair of nodal equations;
a step-current source must be installed at each node in order to provide the
proper initial conditions. The factors multiplying each integral have the
general form of inverses of certain equivalent inductances. Thus, the second
coefficient in Eq. [18], M/(L 1 L 2 − M 2 ), is 1/L B , or the reciprocal of the
inductance extending between nodes 1 and 2, as shown on the equivalent

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
The ability to simulate circuits that contain magnetically coupled
inductances is a useful skill, especially with circuit dimensions
continuing to decrease. As various loops and partial loops of conductors
are brought closer in new designs, various circuits and subcircuits that
are intended to be isolated from one another inadvertently become
coupled through stray magnetic fields, and interact with one another.
PSpice allows us to incorporate this effect through the component
K_Linear, which links a pair of inductors in the schematic by a
coupling coefficient k in the range of 0 ≤ k ≤ 1.
For example, consider the circuit of Fig. 13.19a, which consists of
two coils whose coupling is described by a mutual inductance of
M = 40 mH, corresponding to a coupling coefficient of k = 0.9428.
The basic circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 13.24a. Note that when firstSECTION 13.3 THE LINEAR TRANSFORMER
placed horizontally in the schematic, the dotted terminal is on the left,
and this is the pin about which the symbol is rotated. Also note that the
K_Linear component is not “wired’’ into the schematic anywhere; its loca-
tion is arbitrary. The two coupled inductors, L1 and L2, are specified along
with the coupling coefficient through the Property Editor (Fig 13.24b).

The circuit is connected to a 100 rad/s (15.92 Hz) sinusoidal voltage
source, a fact which is incorporated by performing a single-frequency
ac sweep. It is also necessary to add two resistors to the schematic in
order for PSpice to perform the simulation without generating an error
message. First, a small series resistance has been inserted between the
voltage source and L1; a value of 1 p was selected to minimize its
effects. Second, a 1000 M resistor (essentially infinite) was connected
to L2. The output of the simulation is a voltage magnitude of 13.33 V

and a phase angle of −3.819 × 10 −8 degrees (essentially zero), in
agreement with the values calculated by hand in Example 13.5.
PSpice also provides two different transformer models, a
linear transformer, XFRM_LINEAR, and an ideal transformer
XFRM_NONLINEAR, a circuit element which is the subject of the
following section. The linear transformer requires that values be speci-
fied for the coupling coefficient and both coil inductances. The ideal
transformer also requires a coupling coefficient, but, as we shall see, an
ideal transformer has infinite or nearly infinite inductance values. Thus,
the remaining parameters required for the part XFRM_NONLINEAR
are the number of turns of wire that form each coil.
13.4 THE IDEAL TRANSFORMER
•
An ideal transformer is a useful approximation of a very tightly coupled trans-
former in which the coupling coefficient is essentially unity and both the pri-
mary and secondary inductive reactances are extremely large in comparison
with the terminating impedances. These characteristics are closely approached
by most well-designed iron-core transformers over a reasonable range of fre-
quencies for a reasonable range of terminal impedances. The approximate
analysis of a circuit containing an iron-core transformer may be achieved very
simply by replacing that transformer with an ideal transformer; the ideal trans-
former may be thought of as a first-order model of an iron-core transformer.
Turns Ratio of an Ideal Transformer
One new concept arises with the ideal transformer: the turns ratio a. The
self-inductance of a coil is proportional to the square of the number of turns
of wire forming the coil. This relationship is valid only if all the flux estab-
lished by the current flowing in the coil links all the turns. In order to
develop this result quantitatively it is necessary to utilize magnetic field
concepts, a subject that is not included in our discussion of circuit analysis.
However, a qualitative argument may suffice. If a current i flows through a
coil of N turns, then N times the magnetic flux of a single-turn coil will be
produced. If we think of the N turns as being coincident, then all the flux
certainly links all the turns. As the current and flux change with time, a volt-
age is then induced in each turn which is N times larger than that caused by
a single-turn coil. Thus, the voltage induced in the N-turn coil must be N 2
times the single-turn voltage. From this, the proportionality between induc-
tance and the square of the numbers of turns arises. It follows that

conventions: the use of the vertical lines between the two coils to indicate
the iron laminations present in many iron-core transformers, the unity value
of the coupling coefficient, and the presence of the symbol 1 :a, suggesting
a turns ratio of N 1 to N 2 .
Let us analyze this transformer in the sinusoidal steady state. The two
mesh equations are
V 1 = jωL 1 I 1 − jωMI 2
[22]
and
0 = − jωMI 1 + (Z L + jωL 2 )I 2
[23]
First, consider the input impedance of an ideal transformer. By solving
Eq. [23] for I 2 and substituting in Eq. [22], we obtain
ω 2 M 2
V 1 = I 1 jωL 1 + I 1
Z L + jωL 2
and
Z in =
V 1
ω 2 M 2
= jωL 1 +

Z L + jωL 2
Since k = 1, M 2 = L 1 L 2 so
Z in = jωL 1 +
ω 2 L 1 L 2
Z L + jωL 2
Besides a unity coupling coefficient, another characteristic of an ideal
transformer is an extremely large impedance for both the primary and sec-
ondary coils, regardless of the operating frequency. This suggests that the
ideal case would be for both L 1 and L 2 to tend to infinity. Their ratio, how-
ever, must remain finite, as specified by the turns ratio. Thus,
L 2 = a 2 L 1
leads to
Z in = jωL 1 +
ω 2 a 2 L 21
Z L + jωa 2 L 1
Now if we let L 1 become infinite, both of the terms on the right-hand side of
the preceding equation become infinite, and the result is indeterminate.
Thus, it is necessary to first combine these two terms:
jωL 1 Z L − ω 2 a 2 L 21 + ω 2 a 2 L 21
Z L + jωa 2 L 1 [24]
jωL 1 Z L
Z L
=
Z L + jωa 2 L 1
Z L /jωL 1 + a 2 [25]
Z in =
or
Z in =
Now as L 1 → ∞, we see that Z in becomes
Z in =
Z L
a 2
[26]
for finite Z L .
This result has some interesting implications, and at least one of them
appears to contradict one of the characteristics of the linear transformer.
The input impedance of an ideal transformer is proportional to the load
513514
CHAPTER 13 MAGNETICALLY COUPLED CIRCUITS
impedance, the proportionality constant being the reciprocal of the square of
the turns ratio. In other words, if the load impedance is a capacitive imped-
ance, then the input impedance is a capacitive impedance. In the linear trans-
former, however, the reflected impedance suffered a sign change in its reac-
tive part; a capacitive load led to an inductive contribution to the input
impedance. The explanation of this occurrence is achieved by first realiz-
ing that Z L /a 2 is not the reflected impedance, although it is often loosely
called by that name. The true reflected impedance is infinite in the ideal
transformer; otherwise it could not “cancel’’ the infinite impedance of the
primary inductance. This cancellation occurs in the numerator of Eq. [24].
The impedance Z L /a 2 represents a small term which is the amount by which
an exact cancellation does not occur. The true reflected impedance in the
ideal transformer does change sign in its reactive part; as the primary and
secondary inductances become infinite, however, the effect of the infinite
primary-coil reactance and the infinite, but negative, reflected reactance of
the secondary coil is one of cancellation.
The first important characteristic of the ideal transformer is therefore its
ability to change the magnitude of an impedance, or to change impedance
level. An ideal transformer having 100 primary turns and 10,000 secondary
turns has a turns ratio of 10,000/100, or 100. Any impedance placed across
the secondary then appears at the primary terminals reduced in magnitude
by a factor of 100 2 , or 10,000. A 20,000 resistor looks like 2 , a 200 mH
inductor looks like 20 μH, and a 100 pF capacitor looks like 1 μF. If the pri-
mary and secondary windings are interchanged, then a = 0.01 and the load
impedance is apparently increased in magnitude. In practice, this exact
change in magnitude does not always occur, for we must remember that as
we took the last step in our derivation and allowed L 1 to become infinite in
Eq. [25], it was necessary to neglect Z L in comparison with jωL 2 . Since L 2
can never be infinite, it is evident that the ideal transformer model will be-
come invalid if the load impedances are very large.
Use of Transformers for Impedance Matching
A practical example of the use of an iron-core transformer as a device for
changing impedance level is in the coupling of an amplifier to a speaker sys-
tem. In order to achieve maximum power transfer, we know that the resis-
tance of the load should be equal to the internal resistance of the source; the
speaker usually has an impedance magnitude (often assumed to be a resis-
tance) of only a few ohms, while an amplifier may possess an internal
resistance of several thousand ohms. Thus, an ideal transformer is required
in which N 2 < N 1 . For example, if the amplifier internal impedance is
4000 and the speaker impedance is 8 , then we desire that

There is a simple relationship between the primary and secondary currents
I 1 and I 2 in an ideal transformer. From Eq. [23],
I 2
jωM

I 1
Z L + jωL 2
Once again we allow L 2 to become infinite, and it follows that

[27]
Thus, the ratio of the primary and secondary currents is the turns ratio. If we
have N 2 > N 1 , then a > 1, and it is apparent that the larger current flows in
the winding with the smaller number of turns. In other words,
N 1 I 1 = N 2 I 2
It should also be noted that the current ratio is the negative of the turns ratio
if either current is reversed or if either dot location is changed.
In our example in which an ideal transformer was used to change the im-
pedance level to efficiently match a speaker to an amplifier, an rms current of
50 mA at 1000 Hz in the primary causes an rms current of 1.12 A at 1000 Hz
in the secondary. The power delivered to the speaker is (1.12) 2 (8), or 10 W,
and the power delivered to the transformer by the power amplifier is
(0.05) 2 4000, or 10 W. The result is comforting, since the ideal transformer
contains neither an active device which can generate power nor any resistor
which can absorb power.
Use of Transformers for Voltage Level Adjustment
Since the power delivered to the ideal transformer is identical with that de-
livered to the load, whereas the primary and secondary currents are related
by the turns ratio, it should seem reasonable that the primary and secondary
voltages must also be related to the turns ratio. If we define the secondary
voltage, or load voltage, as
V 2 = I 2 Z L
and the primary voltage as the voltage across L 1 , then
V 1 = I 1 Z in = I 1
The ratio of the two voltages then becomes

The ratio of the secondary to the primary voltage is equal to the turns ra-
tio. We should take care to note that this equation is opposite that of Eq. [27],
and this is a common source of error for students. This ratio may also be neg-
ative if either voltage is reversed or either dot location is changed.
Simply by choosing the turns ratio, therefore, we now have the ability to
change any ac voltage to any other ac voltage. If a > 1, the secondary volt-
age will be greater than the primary voltage, and we have what is commonly
referred to as a step-up transformer. If a < 1, the secondary voltage will
be less than the primary voltage, and we have a step-down transformer.
Utility companies typically generate power at a voltage in the range of 12 to
25 kV. Although this is a rather large voltage, transmission losses over
long distances can be reduced by increasing the level to several hundred
thousand volts using a step-up transformer (Fig. 13.26a). This voltage is
then reduced to several tens of kilovolts at substations for local power
distribution using step-down transformers (Fig. 13.26b). Additional step-
down transformers are located outside buildings to reduce the voltage from
the transmission voltage to the 110 or 220 V level required to operate
machinery (Fig. 13.26c).
Combining the voltage and current ratios, Eqs. [27] and [28],
V 2 I 2 = V 1 I 1

and we see that the primary and secondary complex voltamperes are
equal. The magnitude of this product is usually specified as a maximum

then V 2 leads I 2 by an angle θ . Moreover, the input impedance is Z L /a 2 ,
and thus V 1 also leads I 1 by the same angle θ . If we let the voltage and cur-
rent represent rms values, then |V 2 | |I 2 | cos θ must equal |V 1 | |I 1 | cos θ , and
all the power delivered to the primary terminals reaches the load; none is
absorbed by or delivered to the ideal transformer.
The characteristics of the ideal transformer that we have obtained have
all been determined by phasor analysis. They are certainly true in the
sinusoidal steady state, but we have no reason to believe that they are cor-
rect for the complete response. Actually, they are applicable in general, and
the demonstration that this statement is true is much simpler than the
phasor-based analysis we have just completed. Our analysis, however, has
served to point out the specific approximations that must be made on a more
exact model of an actual transformer in order to obtain an ideal transformer.
For example, we have seen that the reactance of the secondary winding
must be much greater in magnitude than the impedance of any load that is
connected to the secondary. Some feeling for those operating conditions
under which a transformer ceases to behave as an ideal transformer is thus
achieved.517

Voltage Relationship in the Time Domain
Let us now determine how the time-domain quantities v 1 and v 2 are related
in the ideal transformer. Returning to the circuit shown in Fig. 13.17 and the
two equations, [16] and [17], describing it, we may solve the second equa-
tion for di 2 /dt and substitute in the first equation:

The relationship between primary and secondary voltage therefore does

The phase angles can be ignored in this example as
they do not impact the calculation of average power
dissipated by a purely resistive load.PRACTICAL APPLICATION
Superconducting Transformers
For the most part, we have neglected the various types of
losses that may be present in a particular transformer.
When dealing with large power transformers, however,
close attention must be paid to such nonidealities, de-
spite overall efficiencies of typically 97 percent or more.
Although such a high efficiency may seem nearly ideal,
it can represent a great deal of wasted energy when the
transformer is handling several thousand amperes.
So-called i 2 R (pronounced “eye-squared-R”) losses rep-
resent power dissipated as heat, which can increase the
temperature of the transformer coils. Wire resistance
increases with temperature, so heating only leads to
greater losses. High temperatures can also lead to
degradation of the wire insulation, resulting in shorter
transformer life. As a result, many modern power trans-
formers employ a liquid oil bath to remove excess heat
from the transformer coils. Such an approach has its
drawbacks, however, including environmental impact
and fire danger from leaking oil as a result of corrosion
over time (Fig. 13.28).
One possible means of improving the performance of
such transformers is to make use of superconducting
wire to replace the resistive coils of a standard trans-
former design. Superconductors are materials that are
resistive at high temperature, but suddenly show no re-
sistance to the flow of current below a critical tempera-
ture. Most elements are superconducting only near

Integrating,
i 1 = −ai 2 + A
where A is a constant of integration that does not vary with time. Thus, if we
neglect any direct currents in the two windings and fix our attention only onabsolute zero, requiring expensive liquid helium–based
cryogenic cooling. With the discovery in the 1980s of ce-
ramic superconductors having critical temperatures of
90 K ( − 183°C) and higher, it became possible to replace
helium–based equipment with significantly cheaper
liquid nitrogen systems.
Figure 13.29 shows a prototype partial-core super-
conducting transformer being developed at the Univer-
sity of Canterbury. This design employs environmentally
benign liquid nitrogen in place of an oil bath, and is also
significantly smaller than a comparably rated conven-
tional transformer. The result is a measurable improve-
ment in overall transformer efficiency, which translates
into operational cost savings for the owner.
Still, all designs have disadvantages that must be
weighed against their potential advantages, and super-
conducting transformers are no exception. The most sig-
nificant obstacle at present is the relatively high cost of
fabricating superconducting wire several kilometers in
length compared to copper wire. Part of this is due to the
challenge of fabricating long wires from ceramic materi-
als, but part of it is also due to the silver tubing used to
surround the superconductor to provide a low-resistance
current path in the event of a cooling system failure (al-
though less expensive than silver, copper reacts with the
ceramic and is therefore not a viable alternative). The net
result is that although a superconducting transformer is
likely to save a utility money over a long period of
time—many transformers see over 30 years of service—

the initial cost is much higher than for a traditional resis-
tive transformer. At present, many companies (including
utilities) are driven by short-term cost considerations
and are not always eager to make large capital invest-
ments with only long-term cost benefits.
the time-varying portion of the response, then
i 1 = −ai 2
The minus sign arises from the placement of the dots and selection of the
current directions in Fig. 13.17.
The same current and voltage relationships are therefore obtained in
the time domain as were obtained previously in the frequency domain, pro-
vided that dc components are ignored. The time-domain results are more
general, but they have been obtained by a less informative process.
Equivalent Circuits

be utilized to simplify circuits in which ideal transformers appear. Let us as-

of an ideal transformer are represented by their Thévenin equivalents.
Thévenin’s or Norton’s theorem may be used to achieve an equivalent
circuit that does not contain a transformer. For example, let us determine the
Thévenin equivalent of the network to the left of the secondary terminals.
Open-circuiting the secondary, I 2 = 0 and therefore I 1 = 0 (remember that
L 1 is infinite). No voltage appears across Z g1 , and thus V 1 = V s1 and
V 2oc = aV s1 . The Thévenin impedance is obtained by setting V s1 to zero
and utilizing the square of the turns ratio, being careful to use the reciprocal
turns ratio, since we are looking in at the secondary terminals. Thus,
Z th2 = Z g1 a 2 .
As a check on our equivalent, let us also determine the short-circuit sec-
ondary current I 2sc . With the secondary short-circuited, the primary genera-
tor faces an impedance of Z g1 , and, thus, I 1 = V s1 /Z g1 . Therefore,
I 2sc = V s1 /aZ g1 . The ratio of the open-circuit voltage to the short-circuit
current is a 2 Z g1 , as it should be. The Thévenin equivalent of the transformer
and primary circuit is shown in the circuit of Fig. 13.31.

■ FIGURE 13.31 The Thévenin equivalent of the network to
the left of the secondary terminals in Fig. 13.30 is used to
simplify that circuit.
Each primary voltage may therefore be multiplied by the turns ratio,
each primary current divided by the turns ratio, and each primary imped-
ance multiplied by the square of the turns ratio; and then these modified
voltages, currents, and impedances replace the given voltages, currents, and
impedances plus the transformer. If either dot is interchanged, the equiva-
lent may be obtained by using the negative of the turns ratio.521
SECTION 13.4 THE IDEAL TRANSFORMER
Note that this equivalence, as illustrated by Fig. 13.31, is possible only
if the network connected to the two primary terminals, and that connected
to the two secondary terminals, can be replaced by their Thévenin equiva-
lents. That is, each must be a two-terminal network. For example, if we
cut the two primary leads at the transformer, the circuit must be divided into
two separate networks; there can be no element or network bridging across
the transformer between primary and secondary.
A similar analysis of the transformer and the secondary network shows
that everything to the right of the primary terminals may be replaced by an
identical network without the transformer, each voltage being divided by a,
each current being multiplied by a, and each impedance being divided by
a 2 . A reversal of either winding requires the use of a turns ratio of −a.
EXAMPLE 13.8
For the circuit given in Fig. 13.32, determine the equivalent circuit
in which the transformer and the secondary circuit are replaced,
and also that in which the transformer and the primary circuit are
replaced.

to the source impedance by means of an ideal transformer.
This is the same circuit we analyzed in Example 13.7. As before, the
input impedance is 10,000/(10) 2 , or 100 and so |I 1 | = 250 mA rms.

and thus find that the source delivers (25 × 10 −3 )(50) = 12.5 W, of
which (25 × 10 −3 ) 2 (100) = 6.25 W is dissipated in the internal resis-
tance of the source and 12.5 − 6.25 = 6.25 W is delivered to the load.
This is the condition for maximum power transfer to the load.
If the secondary circuit and the ideal transformer are removed by the
use of the Thévenin equivalent, the 50 V source and 100 resistor sim-
ply see a 100 impedance, and the simplified circuit of Fig. 13.33a is
obtained. The primary current and voltage are now immediately evident.
If, instead, the network to the left of the secondary terminals is
replaced by its Thévenin equivalent, we find (keeping in mind the
location of the dots) V th = −10(50) = −500 V rms, and Z th =

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
Transformers play a critical role in the power industry, allowing voltages to
be stepped up for transmission, and stepped down to the level required for
individual pieces of equipment. In this chapter, we studied transformers in
the broader context of magnetically coupled circuits, where the magnetic
flux associated with current can link two or more elements in a circuit (or
even neighboring circuits). This is most easily understood by extending the
concept of inductance studied in Chap. 7 to introduce the idea of mutual
inductance (also having units of henrys). We saw that the coefficient M of
mutual inductance is limited to less than
√ the geometric mean of the two
inductances being coupled (i.e., M ≤ L 1 L 2 ), and made use of the dot
convention to determine the polarity of the voltage induced across one
inductance as a result of current flowing through the other. When the two
inductances are not particularly close, M might be rather small. However, in
the case of a well-designed transformer, it might approach its maximum
value. To describe such situations, we introduced the concept of the cou-
pling coefficient k. When dealing with a linear transformer, analysis may be
assisted by representing the element with an equivalent T (or, less com-
monly, ) network, but a great deal of circuit analysis is performed assum-
ing an ideal transformer. In such instances we no longer concern ourselves
with M or k, but rather the turns ratio a. We saw that the voltages across the
primary and secondary coils, as well as their individual currents, are related
by this parameter. This approximation is very useful for both analysis and
design. We concluded the chapter with a brief discussion of how Thévenin’s
theorem can be applied to circuits with ideal transformers.
We could continue, as the study of inductively coupled circuits is an in-
teresting and important topic, but at this point it might be appropriate to list
some of the key concepts we have already discussed, along with corre-
sponding example numbers.

Mutual inductance describes the voltage induced at the ends of a coil
due to the magnetic field generated by a second coil. (Example 13.1)EXERCISES

❑
The dot convention allows a sign to be assigned to the mutual
inductance term. (Example 13.1)
According to the dot convention, a current entering the dotted terminal
of one coil produces an open-circuit voltage with a positive voltage
reference at the dotted terminal of the second coil. (Examples 13.1,
13.2, 13.3)
The total energy stored in a pair of coupled coils has three separate
terms: the energy stored in each self-inductance ( 12 Li 2 ), and the energy
stored in the mutual inductance (Mi 1 i 2 ). (Example 13.4)
√
The coupling coefficient is given by k = M/ L 1 L 2 , and is restricted
to values between 0 and 1. (Example 13.4)
A linear transformer consists of two coupled coils: the primary
winding and the secondary winding. (Examples 13.5, 13.6)
An ideal transformer is a useful approximation for practical iron-core
transformers. The coupling coefficient is taken to be unity, and the in-
ductance values are assumed to be infinite. (Examples 13.7, 13.8)
The turns ratio a = N 2 /N 1 of an ideal transformer relates the primary
and secondary coil voltages: V 2 = aV 1 . (Example 13.8)
The turns ratio a also relates the currents in the primary and secondary
coils: I 1 = aI 2 . (Examples 13.7, 13.8)

KEY CONCEPTS
Complex Frequency
INTRODUCTION
When faced with time-varying sources, or a circuit with switches
installed, we have several choices with respect to the analysis
approach. Chapters 7 through 9 detail direct differential equation–
based analysis, which is particularly useful when examining turn-on
or turn-off transients. In contrast, Chaps. 10 to 13 describe analysis
situations where sinusoidal excitation is assumed, and transients
are of little or no interest. Unfortunately, not all sources are sinu-
soidal, and there are times when both transient and steady-state
responses are required. In such instances, the Laplace transform
proves to be a highly valuable tool.
Many textbooks simply launch straight into the Laplace trans-
form integral, but this approach conveys no intuitive understand-
ing. For this reason, we have chosen to first introduce what may
strike the reader at first as a somewhat odd concept—the notion of
a “complex” frequency. Simply a mathematical convenience, com-
plex frequency allows us to manipulate both periodic and nonperi-
odic time-varying quantities in parallel, greatly simplifying the
analysis. After getting a feel for the basic technique, we develop it
as a specific circuit analysis tool in Chap. 15.

COMPLEX FREQUENCY
We introduce the notion of complex frequency by considering a
(purely real) exponentially damped sinusoidal function, such as the
voltage
v(t) = V m e σ t cos(ωt + θ)
[1]
533534
CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
where σ (sigma) is a real quantity and is usually negative. Although we often
refer to this function as being “damped,’’ it is conceivable that we might
occasionally encounter a situation where σ > 0 and hence the sinusoidal
amplitude is increasing. (In Chap. 9, our study of the natural response of the
RLC circuit also indicates that σ is the negative of the exponential damping
coefficient.)
Note that we may construct a constant voltage from Eq. [1] by letting
σ = ω = 0:
v(t) = V m cos θ = V 0
[2]
If we set only σ equal to zero, then we obtain a general sinusoidal voltage
v(t) = V m cos(ωt + θ)
[3]
and if ω = 0, we have the exponential voltage
v(t) = V m cos θ e σ t = V 0 e σ t
[4]
Thus, the damped sinusoid of Eq. [1] includes as special cases the dc
Eq. [2], sinusoidal Eq. [3], and exponential Eq. [4] functions.
Some additional insight into the significance of σ can be obtained by
comparing the exponential function of Eq. [4] with the complex representa-
tion of a sinusoidal function with a zero-degree phase angle,
v(t) = V 0 e jωt
The neper itself was named after the Scottish philoso-
pher and mathematician John Napier (1550–1617) and
his napierian logarithm system; the spelling of his name
is historically uncertain (see, for example, H. A. Wheeler,
IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory 2, 1955, p. 219).
[5]
It is apparent that the two functions, Eqs. [4] and [5], have much in
common. The only difference is that the exponent in Eq. [4] is real and the
one in Eq. [5] is imaginary. The similarity between the two functions is
emphasized by describing σ as a “frequency.’’ This choice of terminology
will be discussed in detail in the following sections, but for now we need
merely note that σ is specifically termed the real part of the complex
frequency. It should not be called the “real frequency,’’ however, for this is
a term that is more suitable for f (or, loosely, for ω). We will also refer to σ
as the neper frequency, the name arising from the dimensionless unit of the
exponent of e. Thus, given e 7t , the dimensions of 7t are nepers (Np), and
7 is the neper frequency in nepers per second.
The General Form
The forced response of a network to a general forcing function of the form
of Eq. [1] can be found very simply by using a method almost identical
with that used in phasor-based analysis. Once we are able to find the forced
response to this damped sinusoid, we will also have found the forced
response to a dc voltage, an exponential voltage, and a sinusoidal voltage.
First we consider σ and ω as the real and imaginary parts of a complex
frequency.
We suggest that any function that may be written in the form
f (t) = Ke st
[6]
where K and s are complex constants (independent of time) is characterized
by the complex frequency s. The complex frequency s is therefore simply535
SECTION 14.1 COMPLEX FREQUENCY
the factor that multiplies t in this complex exponential representation. Until
we are able to determine the complex frequency of a given function by
inspection, it is necessary to write the function in the form of Eq. [6].
The DC Case
We apply this definition first to the more familiar forcing functions. For
example, a constant voltage
v(t) = V 0
may be written in the form
v(t) = V 0 e (0)t
Therefore, we conclude that the complex frequency of a dc voltage or cur-
rent is zero (i.e., s = 0).
The Exponential Case
The next simple case is the exponential function
v(t) = V 0 e σ t
which is already in the required form. The complex frequency of this volt-
age is therefore σ (i.e., s = σ + j0).
The Sinusoidal Case
Now let us consider a sinusoidal voltage, one that may provide a slight
surprise. Given
v(t) = V m cos(ωt + θ)
we desire to find an equivalent expression in terms of the complex expo-
nential. From our past experience, we therefore use the formula we derived
from Euler’s identity,
cos(ωt + θ) = 12 [e j (ωt+θ) + e − j (ωt+θ) ]
and obtain
v(t) = 12 V m [e j (ωt+θ) + e − j (ωt+θ) ]
=

V e jθ
2 m
e jωt +
1
V e − jθ
2 m
e − jωt
or
v(t) = K 1 e s 1 t + K 2 e s 2 t
We have the sum of two complex exponentials, and two complex
frequencies are therefore present, one for each term. The complex frequency
of the first term is s = s 1 = jω, and that of the second term is s = s 2 = − jω.
These two values of s are conjugates, or s 2 = s ∗ 1 and the two values of K are
also conjugates: K 1 = 12 V m e jθ and K 2 = K ∗ 1 = 12 V m e − jθ . The entire first
term and the entire second term are therefore conjugates, which we might
have expected inasmuch as their sum must be a real quantity, v(t).
The complex conjugate of any number can be obtained
by simply replacing all occurrences of ‘’j ’’ with ‘’Ϫj.’’
The concept arises from our arbitrary choice of
j = + −1. However, the negative root is just as
valid, which leads us to the definition of a complex
conjugate.536
CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
The Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Case
Finally, let us determine the complex frequency or frequencies associated
with the exponentially damped sinusoidal function, Eq. [1]. We again use
Euler’s formula to obtain a complex exponential representation:
v(t) = V m e σ t cos(ωt + θ)
= 12 V m e σ t [e j (ωt+θ) + e − j (ωt+θ) ]
and thus
v(t) = 12 V m e jθ e j (σ + jω)t + 12 V m e − jθ e j (σ − jω)t
We find that a conjugate complex pair of frequencies, s 1 = σ + jω
and s 2 = s ∗ 1 = σ − jω, is also required to describe the exponentially
damped sinusoid. In general, neither σ nor ω is zero, and the exponentially
varying sinusoidal waveform is the general case; the constant, sinusoidal,
and exponential waveforms are special cases.
The Relationship of s to Reality
Note that |6 − j8| = 10,
so that V m = 2|K| = 20.
Also, ang(6 − j8) = −53.13 ◦ .
Large magnitudes for the real part of s, the imaginary
part of s, or the magnitude of s indicate a rapidly
varying function.
A positive real value of s, e.g., s = 5 + j0, identifies an exponentially in-
creasing function Ke +5t , where K must be real if the function is to be a
physical one. A negative real value for s, such as s = −5 + j0, refers to an
exponentially decreasing function Ke −5t .
A purely imaginary value of s, such as j10, can never be associated with
a purely real quantity. The functional form is Ke j10t , which can also be writ-
ten as K(cos 10t + j sin 10t); it obviously possesses both a real and an imag-
inary part, each of which is sinusoidal. In order to construct a real function, it
is necessary to consider conjugate values of s, such as s 1,2 = ± j10, with
which must be associated conjugate values of K. Loosely speaking, however,
we may identify either of the complex frequencies s 1 = + j10 or s 2 = − j10
with a sinusoidal voltage at the radian frequency of 10 rad/s; the presence of
the conjugate complex frequency is understood. The amplitude and phase an-
gle of the sinusoidal voltage will depend on the choice of K for each of the
two frequencies. Thus, selecting s 1 = j10 and K 1 = 6 − j8, where
v(t) = K 1 e s 1 t + K 2 e s 2 t
s 2 = s ∗ 1
and
K 2 = K ∗ 1
we obtain the real sinusoid 20 cos(10t − 53.1 ◦ ).
In a similar manner, a general value for s, such as 3 − j5, can be associ-
ated with a real quantity only if it is accompanied by its conjugate, 3 + j5.
Speaking loosely again, we may think of either of these two conjugate fre-
quencies as describing an exponentially increasing sinusoidal function,
e 3t cos 5t ; the specific amplitude and phase angle will again depend on the
values of the conjugate complex K’s.
By now we should have achieved some appreciation of the physical na-
ture of the complex frequency s; in general, it describes an exponentially
varying sinusoid. The real part of s is associated with the exponential varia-
tion; if it is negative, the function decays as t increases; if it is positive, the
function increases; and if it is zero, the sinusoidal amplitude is constant. The
larger the magnitude of the real part of s, the greater is the rate of exponen-
tial increase or decrease. The imaginary part of s describes the sinusoidal
variation; it is specifically the radian frequency. A large magnitude for the
imaginary part of s indicates a more rapidly changing function of time.SECTION 14.2 THE DAMPED SINUSOIDAL FORCING FUNCTION
It is customary to use the letter σ to designate the real part of s, and ω
(not jω) to designate the imaginary part:
s = σ + jω
[7]
The radian frequency is sometimes referred to as the “real frequency,’’ but
this terminology can be very confusing when we find that we must then say
that “the real frequency is the imaginary part of the complex frequency’’!
When we need to be specific, we will call s the complex frequency, σ the
neper frequency, ω the radian frequency, and f = ω/2π the cyclic fre-
quency; when no confusion seems likely, it is permissible to use “frequency’’
to refer to any of these four quantities. The neper frequency is measured in
nepers per second, radian frequency is measured in radians per second, and
complex frequency s is measured in units which are variously termed
complex nepers per second or complex radians per second.

THE DAMPED SINUSOIDAL FORCING FUNCTION
It is time to put this concept of complex frequency to work.
The general exponentially varying sinusoid, which we may represent
with the voltage function
v(t) = V m e σ t cos(ωt + θ)
[8]
can be expressed in terms of the complex frequency s by making use of
Euler’s identity as before:
v(t) = Re{V m e σ t e j (ωt+θ) } [9]
v(t) = Re{V m e σ t e j (−ωt−θ) } [10]
or
Either representation is suitable, and the two expressions should remind us
that a pair of conjugate complex frequencies is associated with a sinusoid or
an exponentially damped sinusoid. Equation [9] is more directly related to
the given damped sinusoid, and we will concern ourselves principally with it.
537538
CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
Collecting factors, we now substitute s = σ + jω into
v(t) = Re{V m e jθ e (σ + jω)t }
and obtain
v(t) = Re{V m e jθ e st }
[11]
Before we apply a forcing function of this form to any circuit, we note the
resemblance of this last representation of the damped sinusoid to the corre-
sponding representation of the undamped sinusoid in Chap. 10,
Re{V m e jθ e jωt }
The only difference is that we now have s where we previously had jω. In-
stead of restricting ourselves to sinusoidal forcing functions and their
radian frequencies, we have now extended our notation to include the
damped sinusoidal forcing function at a complex frequency. It should be no
surprise at all to see later in this section that we will develop a frequency-
domain description of the exponentially damped sinusoid in exactly the
same way that we did for the sinusoid; we will simply omit the Re{ } nota-
tion and suppress e st .
We are now ready to apply the exponentially damped sinusoid, as given
by Eq. [8], [9], [10], or [11], to an electrical network, where the forced
response—perhaps a current in some branch of the network—is desired.
Since the forced response has the form of the forcing function, its integral,
and its derivatives, the response may be assumed to be
i(t) = I m e σ t cos(ωt + φ)
or
i(t) = Re{I m e jφ e st }
where the complex frequency of both the source and the response must be
identical.
If we now recall that the real part of a complex forcing function pro-
duces the real part of the response while the imaginary part of the complex
forcing function causes the imaginary part of the response, then we are
again led to the application of a complex forcing function to our network.
We will obtain a complex response whose real part is the desired real re-
sponse. Actually, we will work with the Re{ } notation omitted, but we
should realize that it may be reinserted at any time and that it must be rein-
serted whenever we desire the time-domain response. Thus, given the real
forcing function
v(t) = Re{V m e jθ e st }
we apply the complex forcing function V m e jθ e st ; the resultant forced re-
sponse I m e jφ e st is complex, and it must have as its real part the desired
time-domain forced response
i(t) = Re{I m e jφ e st }
The solution of our circuit analysis problem consists of the determination of
the unknown response amplitude I m and phase angle φ.539
SECTION 14.2 THE DAMPED SINUSOIDAL FORCING FUNCTION
Before we actually carry out the details of an analysis problem and see
how the procedure resembles what we used in sinusoidal analysis, it is
worthwhile to outline the steps of the basic method.
1. We first characterize the circuit with a set of loop or nodal
integrodifferential equations.
2. The given forcing functions, in complex form, and the assumed forced
responses, also in complex form, are substituted in the equations and
the indicated integrations and differentiations are performed.
3. Each term in every equation will then contain the same factor e st .
We divide throughout by this factor, or “suppress e st ,’’ understanding
that it must be reinserted if a time-domain description of any response
function is desired.
With the Re{ } notation and the e st factor gone, we have converted all the
voltages and currents from the time domain to the frequency domain. The
integrodifferential equations become algebraic equations, and their solution
is obtained just as easily as in the sinusoidal steady state. Let us illustrate the
basic method by a numerical example.
EXAMPLE 14.1
Apply the forcing function v(t) 60e −2t cos(4t + 10°) V to the series
RLC circuit shown in Fig. 14.1, and specify the forced response
by finding values fo I m and φ in the time-domain expression

After manipulating the complex numbers, we find
I = 5.37/−106.6 ◦
Thus, I m is 5.37 A, φ is −106.6 ◦ , and the forced response can be writ-
ten directly (recalling that s = −2 + j4) as
i(t) = 5.37e −2t cos(4t − 106.6 ◦ ) A
We have thus solved the problem by reducing a calculus-based
expression to an algebraic expression. This is only a small indication
of the power of the technique we are about to study.

DEFINITION OF THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
Our constant goal has been one of analysis: given some forcing function at
one point in a linear circuit, determine the response at some other point. For
the first several chapters, we played only with dc forcing functions and
responses of the form V 0 e 0 . However, after the introduction of inductance
and capacitance, the sudden dc excitation of simple RL and RC circuits
produced responses varying exponentially with time: V 0 e σ t . When we
considered the RLC circuit, the responses took on the form of the exponen-
tially varying sinusoid, V 0 e σ t cos(ωt + θ).All this work was accomplished in
the time domain, and the dc forcing function was the only one we considered.
As we advanced to the use of the sinusoidal forcing function, the tedium
and complexity of solving the integrodifferential equations caused us toSECTION 14.3 DEFINITION OF THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
begin casting about for an easier way to work problems. The phasor trans-
form was the result, and we might remember that we were led to it through
consideration of a complex forcing function of the form V 0 e jθ e jωt . As soon
as we concluded that we did not need the factor containing t, we were left
with the phasor V 0 e jθ ; we had arrived at the frequency domain.
Now a little flexing of our cerebral cortex has caused us to apply a forcing
function of the form V 0 e jθ e (σ + jω)t , leading to the invention of the complex
frequency s, and thereby relegating all our previous functional forms to
special cases: dc (s = 0), exponential (s = σ ), sinusoidal (s = jω), and ex-
ponential sinusoid (s = σ + jω). By analogy to our previous experience
with phasors, we saw that in these cases we may omit the factor containing
t, and once again obtain a solution by working in the frequency domain.
The Two-Sided Laplace Transform
We know that sinusoidal forcing functions lead to sinusoidal responses, and
also that exponential forcing functions lead to exponential responses.
However, as practicing engineers we will encounter many waveforms that
are neither sinusoidal nor exponential, such as square waves, sawtooth
waveforms, and pulses beginning at arbitrary instants of time. When such
forcing functions are applied to a linear circuit, we will see that the response
is neither similar to the form of the excitation waveform nor exponential. As
a result, we are not able to eliminate the terms containing t to form a
frequency-domain response. This is rather unfortunate, as working in the
frequency domain has proved to be rather useful.
There is a solution, however, which makes use of a technique that allows
us to expand any function into a sum of exponential waveforms, each with
its own complex frequency. Since we are considering linear circuits, we
know that the total response of our circuit can be obtained by simply adding
the individual response to each exponential waveform. And, in dealing with
each exponential waveform, we may once again neglect any terms contain-
ing t, and work instead in the frequency domain. It unfortunately takes an
infinite number of exponential terms to accurately represent a general time
function, so that taking a brute-force approach and applying superposition
to the exponential series might be somewhat insane. Instead, we will sum
these terms by performing an integration, leading to a frequency-domain
function.
We formalize this approach using what is known as a Laplace transform,
defined for a general function f(t) as
F(s) =
∞
−∞
e −st f(t) dt
[12]
The mathematical derivation of this integral operation requires an under-
standing of Fourier series and the Fourier transform, which are discussed
in Chap. 18. The fundamental concept behind the Laplace transform, how-
ever, can be understood based on our discussion of complex frequency and
our prior experience with phasors and converting back and forth between
the time domain and the frequency domain. In fact, that is precisely what
the Laplace transform does: it converts the general time-domain function
f(t) into a corresponding frequency-domain representation, F(s).

CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
The Two-Sided Inverse Laplace Transform
Equation [12] defines the two-sided, or bilateral, Laplace transform of f(t).
The term two-sided or bilateral is used to emphasize the fact that both pos-
itive and negative values of t are included in the range of integration. The
inverse operation, often referred to as the inverse Laplace transform, is
also defined as an integral expression 1
f (t) =
σ 0 + j∞
1
2π j
σ 0 − j∞
e st F(s) ds
[13]
where the real constant σ 0 is included in the limits to ensure convergence of
this improper integral; the two equations [12] and [13] constitute the two-
sided Laplace transform pair. The good news is that Eq. [13] need never be
invoked in the study of circuit analysis: there is a quick and easy alternative
to look forward to learning.
The One-Sided Laplace Transform
In many of our circuit analysis problems, the forcing and response functions
do not exist forever in time, but rather they are initiated at some specific
instant that we usually select as t = 0. Thus, for time functions that do not
exist for t < 0, or for those time functions whose behavior for t < 0 is of no
interest, the time-domain description can be thought of as v(t)u(t). The defin-
ing integral for the Laplace transform is taken with the lower limit at t = 0 −
in order to include the effect of any discontinuity at t = 0, such as an impulse
or a higher-order singularity. The corresponding Laplace transform is then
F(s) =
∞
−∞
e −st f (t)u(t) dt =
∞
0 −
e −st f (t) dt
This defines the one-sided Laplace transform of f (t), or simply the Laplace
transform of f (t), one-sided being understood. The inverse transform ex-
pression remains unchanged, but when evaluated, it is understood to be
valid only for t > 0. Here then is the definition of the Laplace transform
pair that we will use from now on:

The script
may also be used to indicate the direct or inverse Laplace
transform operation:
F(s) =
{ f (t)}
and
f (t) =
−1
{F(s)}
(1) If we ignore the distracting factor of 1/2π j and view the integral as a summation over all frequencies
such that f (t) ∝ [F(s) ds]e st , this reinforces the notion that f (t) is indeed a sum of complex frequency
terms having a magnitude proportional to F(s).SECTION 14.4 LAPLACE TRANSFORMS OF SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS

LAPLACE TRANSFORMS OF SIMPLE
• TIME FUNCTIONS
In this section we will begin to build up a catalog of Laplace transforms for
those time functions most frequently encountered in circuit analysis; we
will assume for now that the function of interest is a voltage, although such
a choice is strictly arbitrary. We will create this catalog, at least initially, by
utilizing the definition,
V(s) =
∞
0 −
e −st v(t) dt =
{v(t)}
which, along with the expression for the inverse transform,
v(t) =

2π j
σ 0 + j∞
σ 0 − j∞
e st V(s) ds =

{V(s)}
establishes a one-to-one correspondence between v(t) and V(s). That is, for
every v(t) for which V(s) exists, there is a unique V(s). At this point, we
may be looking with some trepidation at the rather ominous form given for
the inverse transform. Fear not! As we will see shortly, an introductory
study of Laplace transform theory does not require actual evaluation of this
integral. By going from the time domain to the frequency domain and tak-
ing advantage of the uniqueness just mentioned, we will be able to generate
a catalog of transform pairs that will already contain the corresponding time
function for nearly every transform that we wish to invert.544
CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
Before we continue, however, we should pause to consider whether
there is any chance that the transform may not even exist for some v(t) that
concerns us. A set of conditions sufficient to ensure the absolute conver-
gence of the Laplace integral for Re{s} > σ 0 is
1. The function v(t) is integrable in every finite interval t 1 < t < t 2 ,
where 0 ≤ t 1 < t 2 < ∞.
2. lim e −σ 0 t |v(t)| exists for some value of σ 0 .
t→∞
Time functions that do not satisfy these conditions are seldom encountered
by the circuit analyst. 2
The Unit-Step Function u(t)
Now let us look at some specific transforms. We first examine the Laplace
transform of the unit-step function u(t). From the defining equation, we may
write
{u(t)} =

e −st u(t) dt =

for Re{s} > 0, to satisfy condition 2. Thus,
The double arrow notation is commonly used to
indicate Laplace transform pairs.
u(t) ⇔

s
[16]
and our first Laplace transform pair has been established with great ease.
The Unit-Impulse Function δ(t − t 0 )
A singularity function whose transform is of considerable interest is the
unit-impulse function δ(t − t 0 ). This function, plotted in Fig. 14.2, seems
rather strange at first but is enormously useful in practice. The unit-impulse
function is defined to have an area of unity, so that
t 0

■ FIGURE 14.2 The unit-impulse function δ (t Ϫ t 0 ).
This function is often used to approximate a signal
pulse whose duration is very short compared to circuit
time constants.
δ(t − t 0 ) = 0
t 0 +ε
t 0 −ε
t = t 0
δ(t − t 0 ) dt = 1
where ε is a small constant. Thus, this “function’’ (a naming that makes
many purist mathematicians cringe) has a nonzero value only at the point
t 0 . For t 0 > 0 − , we therefore find the Laplace transform to be
∞
{δ(t − t 0 )} =
0 −
e −st δ(t − t 0 ) dt = e −st 0
δ(t − t 0 ) ⇔ e −st 0
2
t
[17]
(2) Examples of such functions are e t and e e , but not t n or n t . For a somewhat more detailed discussion
of the Laplace transform and its applications, refer to Clare D. McGillem and George R. Cooper, Continuous
and Discrete Signal and System Analysis, 3d ed. Oxford University Press, North Carolina: 1991, Chap. 5.SECTION 14.4 LAPLACE TRANSFORMS OF SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS
In particular, note that we obtain
δ(t) ⇔ 1
[18]
for t 0 = 0.
An interesting feature of the unit-impulse function is known as the
sifting property. Consider the integral of the impulse function multiplied by
an arbitrary function f (t):
∞
−∞
f (t)δ(t − t 0 ) dt
Since the function δ(t − t 0 ) is zero everywhere except at t = t 0 , the value of
this integral is simply f (t 0 ). The property turns out to be very useful in sim-
plifying integral expressions containing the unit-impulse function.
The Exponential Function e −αt
Recalling our past interest in the exponential function, we examine its
transform,
{e −αt u(t)} =
∞
0 −
=−
e −αt e −st dt
1 −(s+α)t
e
s + α
∞

s + α
and therefore,
e −αt u(t) ⇐⇒
1
s + α
[19]
It is understood that Re{s} > −α.
The Ramp Function tu(t)
As a final example, for the moment, let us consider the ramp function tu(t).
We obtain
{tu(t)} =
∞
0 −
te −st dt =
tu(t) ⇔
1
s 2

[20]
either by a straightforward integration by parts or from a table of integrals.
So what of the function te −αt u(t)? We leave it to the reader to show that
te −αt u(t) ⇔
1
(s + α) 2
[21]
There are, of course, quite a few additional time functions worth con-
sidering, but it may be best if we pause for the moment to consider the
reverse of the process—the inverse Laplace transform—before returning
to add to our list.

INVERSE TRANSFORM TECHNIQUES
The Linearity Theorem
Although we mentioned that Eq. [13] can be applied to convert an s-domain
expression into a time-domain expression, we also alluded to the fact that this
is more work than required—if we’re willing to exploit the uniqueness of any
Laplace transform pair. In order to fully capitalize on this fact, we must
first introduce one of several helpful and well-known Laplace transform
theorems—the linearity theorem. This theorem states that the Laplace trans-
form of the sum of two or more time functions is equal to the sum of the
transforms of the individual time functions. For two time functions we have
{ f 1 (t) + f 2 (t)} =
=
∞
0 −
∞
0 −
e −st [ f 1 (t) + f 2 (t)] dt
e −st f 1 (t) dt +
∞
0 −
e −st f 2 (t) dt
= F 1 (s) + F 2 (s)
This is known as the “additive property’’ of the Laplace
transform.
As an example of the use of this theorem, suppose that we have a
Laplace transform V(s) and want to know the corresponding time function
v(t). It will often be possible to decompose V(s) into the sum of two or
more functions, e.g., V 1 (s) and V 2 (s), whose inverse transforms, v 1 (t) and
v 2 (t), are already tabulated. It then becomes a simple matter to apply the
linearity theorem and write
v(t) = −1
= −1
{V(s)} =
{V 1 (s)} +
−1
{V 1 (s) + V 2 (s)}
−1
{V 2 (s)} = v 1 (t) + v 2 (t)
Another important consequence of the linearity theorem is evident by
studying the definition of the Laplace transform. Since we are working with
an integral, the Laplace transform of a constant times a function is equal to
the constant times the Laplace transform of the function. In other words,
{kv(t)} = k {v(t)}
or
kv(t) ⇔ kV(s)
This is known as the “homogeneity property’’ of the
Laplace transform.
[22]
where k is a constant of proportionality. This result is extremely handy in
many situations that arise from circuit analysis, as we will see.SECTION 14.5 INVERSE TRANSFORM TECHNIQUES

EXAMPLE 14.3
Given the function G(s) = (7/s) − 31/(s + 17), obtain g(t).
This s-domain function is composed of the sum of two terms, 7/s
and −31/(s + 17). Through the linearity theorem we know that g(t)
will be composed of two terms as well, each the inverse Laplace
transform of one of the two s-domain terms:
−1
g(t) =
7

Inverse Transform Techniques for
Rational Functions
In analyzing circuits with multiple energy storage elements, we will often
encounter s-domain expressions that are ratios of s-polynomials. We thus
expect to routinely encounter expressions of the form
N(s)
V(s) =
D(s)
where N(s) and D(s) are polynomials in s. The values of s which lead to
N(s) = 0 are referred to as zeros of V(s), and those values of s which lead
to D(s) = 0 are referred to as poles of V(s).
Rather than rolling up our sleeves and invoking Eq. [13] each time we
need to find an inverse transform, it is often possible to decompose these ex-
pressions using the method of residues into simpler terms whose inverse
transforms are already known. The criterion for this is that V(s) must be a
rational function for which the degree of the numerator N(s) must be less
than that of the denominator D(s). If it is not, we must first perform a sim-
ple division step, as shown in the following example. The result will include
an impulse function (assuming the degree of the numerator is the same as
that of the denominator) and a rational function. The inverse transform of
the first is simple; the straightforward method of residues applies to the ra-
tional function if its inverse transform is not already known.
In practice, it is seldom necessary to ever invoke Eq. [13]
for functions encountered in circuit analysis, provided
that we are clever in using the various techniques pre-
sented in this chapter.548

14.8 Given the function Q(s) =
3s 2 − 4
, find q(t).
s 2
Ans: q(t) = 3δ(t) − 4tu(t) .
In employing the method of residues, essentially performing a partial
fraction expansion of V(s), we focus our attention on the roots of the
denominator. Thus, it is first necessary to factor the s-polynomial that com-
prises D(s) into a product of binomial terms. The roots of D(s) may be any
combination of distinct or repeated roots, and may be real or complex. It is
worth noting, however, that complex roots always occur as conjugate pairs,
provided that the coefficients of D(s) are real.
Distinct Poles and the Method of Residues
As a specific example, let us determine the inverse Laplace transform of
1
V(s) =
(s + α)(s + β)
The denominator has been factored into two distinct roots, −α and −β.
Although it is possible to substitute this expression in the defining equation
for the inverse transform, it is much easier to utilize the linearity theorem.
Using partial-fraction expansion, we can split the given transform into the
sum of two simpler transforms,
A
B
V(s) =
+
s + α s + β
In this equation, we use the single-fraction
(i.e., nonexpanded) version of V(s).
where A and B may be found by any of several methods. Perhaps the quick-
est solution is obtained by recognizing that

Recognizing that the second term is always zero, in practice we would sim-
ply write
A = (s + α)V(s)| s=−α
Similarly,
B = (s + β)V(s)| s=−β =
1
α − β
and therefore,
1/(β − α) 1/(α − β)

Laplace pairs,

(e −αt − e −βt )u(t) ⇔

This approach is easily extended to functions whose denominators are
higher-order s-polynomials, although the operations can become somewhat
tedious. It should also be noted that we did not specify that the constants A
and B must be real. However, in situations where α and β are complex, we
will find that α and β are also complex conjugates (this is not required
mathematically, but is required for physical circuits). In such instances, we
will also find that A = B ∗ ; in other words, the coefficients will be complex
conjugates as well.
EXAMPLE 14.5
Determine the inverse transform of
P(s) =
7s + 5

one, whereas the degree of the denominator is two), so we begin by
factoring the denominator and write:
P(s) =

Repeated Poles
A closely related situation is that of repeated poles. Consider the function
V(s) =
N(s)
(s − p) n
which we want to expand into
V(s) =
a n
a n−1
a 1
+
+ ··· +
(s − p) n
(s − p) n−1
(s − p)
To determine each constant, we first multiply the nonexpanded version of
V(s) by (s − p) n . The constant a n is found by evaluating the resulting ex-
pression at s = p. The remaining constants are found by differentiating the
expression (s − p) n V(s) the appropriate number of times prior to evaluat-
ing at s = p, and dividing by a factorial term. The differentiation procedure
removes the constants previously found, and evaluating at s = p removes
the remaining constants.
For example, a n−2 is found by evaluating
1 d 2
[(s − p) n V(s)] s= p
2! ds 2
and the term a n−k is found by evaluating
1 d k
[(s − p) n V(s)] s= p
k! ds k
To illustrate the basic procedure, let’s find the inverse Laplace transform
of a function having a combination of both situations: one pole at s = 0 and
two poles at s = −6.
EXAMPLE 14.6
Compute the inverse transform of the function

two at s = −6. Next, we expand the function into

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
MATLAB, a very powerful numerical analysis package, can be used to
assist in the solution of equations arising from the analysis of circuits
with time-varying excitation in several different ways. The most
straightforward technique makes use of ordinary differential equation552
CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
(ODE) solver routines ode23() and ode45(). These two routines are
based on numerical methods of solving differential equations, with
ode45() having greater accuracy. The solution is determined only at
discrete points, however, and therefore is not known for all values of
time. For many applications this is adequate, provided a sufficient
density of points is used.
The Laplace transform technique provides us with the means of
obtaining an exact expression for the solution of differential equations,
and as such has many advantages over the use of numerical ODE
solution techniques. Another significant advantage to the Laplace
transform technique will become apparent in subsequent chapters when
we study the significance of the form of s-domain expressions,
particularly once we factor the denominator polynomials.
As we have already seen, lookup tables can be handy when working
with Laplace transforms, although the method of residues can become
somewhat tedious for functions with higher-order polynomials in their
denominators. In these instances MATLAB can also be of assistance, as
it contains several useful functions for the manipulation of polynomial
expressions.
In MATLAB, the polynomial
p(x) = a n x n + a n−1 x n−1 + · · · + a 1 x + a 0
is stored as the vector [a n a n−1 . . . a 1 a 0 ]. Thus, to define the polynomi-
als N(s) = 2 and D(s) = s 3 + 12s 2 + 36s we write
EDU» N = [2];
EDU» D = [1 12 36 0];
The roots of either polynomial can be obtained by invoking the function
roots(p), where p is a vector containing the coefficients of the polyno-
mial. For example,
EDU» q = [1 8 16];
EDU» roots(q)
yields
ans =
− 4
− 4
MATLAB also enables us to determine the residues of the rational
function N(s)/D(s) using the function residue(). For example,
EDU» [r p y] = residue(N, D);
returns three vectors r, p, and y, such that
N(s)

BASIC THEOREMS FOR THE LAPLACE
TRANSFORM
We are now able to consider two theorems that might be considered collec-
tively the raison d’être for Laplace transforms in circuit analysis—the time
differentiation and integration theorems. These will help us transform the
derivatives and integrals appearing in the time-domain circuit equations.
Time Differentiation Theorem
Let us look at time differentiation first by considering a time function v(t)
whose Laplace transform V(s) is known to exist. We want the transform of
the first derivative of v(t),
dv

e −st dv

U = e −st
with the result
dv

∞
0 −
+ s
∞
0 −
e −st v(t) dt
The first term on the right must approach zero as t increases without limit;
otherwise V(s) would not exist. Hence,
dv
dt
= 0 − v(0 − ) + sV(s)
and
dv
⇔ sV(s) − v(0 − )
dt
[23]
553554
CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
Similar relationships may be developed for higher-order derivatives:
d 2 v
⇔ s 2 V(s) − sv(0 − ) − v (0 − )
dt 2 [24]
d 3 v
⇔ s 3 V(s) − s 2 v(0 − ) − sv (0 − ) − v (0 − )
dt 3 [25]
where v (0 − ) is the value of the first derivative of v(t) evaluated at t = 0 − ,
v (0 − ) is the initial value of the second derivative of v(t), and so forth.
When all initial conditions are zero, we see that differentiating once with re-
spect to t in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by s in the fre-
quency domain; differentiating twice in the time domain corresponds to
multiplication by s 2 in the frequency domain, and so on. Thus, differentia-
tion in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency do-
main. This is a substantial simplification! We also notice that, when the ini-
tial conditions are not zero, their presence is still accounted for.

᭤ Collect the known information.
The network is driven by a step voltage, and we are given an initial
value of the current (at t = 0 − ) of 5 A.
᭤ Devise a plan.
Applying KVL to the circuit will result in a differential equation with
i(t) as the unknown. Taking the Laplace transform of both sides of
this equation will convert it to the s-domain. Solving the resulting
algebraic equation for I(s), the inverse Laplace transform will yield i(t).
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.
Using KVL to write the single-loop equation in the time domain,

Now, we take the Laplace transform of each term, so that
3
2[sI(s) − i(0 − )] + 4I(s) =

᭤ Determine if additional information is required.
We have an equation that may be solved for the frequency-domain
representation I(s) of our goal, i(t).
᭤ Attempt a solution.
We next solve for I(s), substituting i(0 − ) = 5:

i(t) = 0.75u(t) + 4.25e −2t u(t)
= (0.75 + 4.25e −2t )u(t) A
᭤ Verify the solution. Is it reasonable or expected?
Based on our previous experience with this type of circuit, we
expected a dc forced response plus an exponentially decaying natural
response. At t = 0, we obtain i(0) = 5 A, as required, and as t → ∞,
i(t) → 34 A as we would expect.
Our solution for i(t) is therefore complete. Both the forced re-
sponse 0.75u(t) and the natural response 4.25e −2t u(t) are present,
and the initial condition was automatically incorporated into the
solution. The method illustrates a very painless way of obtaining the
complete solution of many differential equations.

But, since e → 0 as t → ∞ , the first term on the right vanishes at the up-

and thus integration in the time domain corresponds to division by s in the

in the time domain simplifies to an algebraic operation in the frequency
domain.

CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
Laplace Transforms of Sinusoids
To illustrate the use of both the linearity theorem and the time-differentiation
theorem, not to mention the addition of a most important pair to our forth-
coming Laplace transform table, let us establish the Laplace transform of
sin ωt u(t). We could use the defining integral expression with integration
by parts, but this is needlessly difficult. Instead, we use the relationship
sin ωt =
1 jωt
(e − e − jωt )
2 j
The transform of the sum of these two terms is just the sum of the trans-
forms, and each term is an exponential function for which we already have
the transform. We may immediately write
{sin ωt u(t)} =
sin ωt u(t) ⇔

s − jω s + jω

[27]
We next use the time-differentiation theorem to determine the transform of
cos ωt u(t), which is proportional to the derivative of sin ωt . That is,
{cos ωt u(t)} =
Note that we have made use of the fact
that sin ω t t =0 = 0.

The Time-Shift Theorem
As we have seen in some of our earlier transient problems, not all forcing
functions begin at t = 0. What happens to the transform of a time function
if that function is simply shifted in time by some known amount? In partic-
ular, if the transform of f (t)u(t) is the known function F(s), then what is
the transform of f (t − a)u(t − a), the original time function delayed by a
seconds (and not existing for t < a)? Working directly from the definition
of the Laplace transform, we get
∞
{ f (t − a)u(t − a)} =
0 −
∞
=
a −
e −st f (t − a)u(t − a) dt
e −st f (t − a) dt
for t ≥ a − . Choosing a new variable of integration, τ = t − a, we obtain
{ f (t − a)u(t − a)} =
∞
0 −
e −s(τ +a) f (τ ) dτ = e −as F(s)
Therefore,
f (t − a)u(t − a) ⇔ e −as F(s)
(a ≥ 0)
[29]
This result is known as the time-shift theorem, and it simply states that if a
time function is delayed by a time a in the time domain, the result in the fre-
quency domain is a multiplication by e −as .559

Determine the transform of the rectangular pulse v(t) = u(t − 2) −
u(t − 5).

This pulse, shown plotted in Fig. 14.8, has unit value for the time inter-
val 2 < t < 5 , and zero value elsewhere. We know that the transform of
u(t) is just 1/s , and since u(t − 2) is simply u(t) delayed by 2 s, the
transform of this delayed function is e −2s /s . Similarly, the transform of
u(t − 5) is e −5s /s . It follows, then, that the desired transform is

addition, we have noted the consequences in the s domain of the time-domain
operations of addition, multiplication by a constant, differentiation, and inte-
gration. These results are collected in Tables 14.1 and 14.2; several others
which are derived in Appendix 7 are also included.

Stability of a System
Many years ago (or so it seems), one of the authors was
driving along a country road and attempting to make use
of the electronic speed control (“cruise control”) feature
of the automobile. After turning the system on and man-
ually setting the vehicular speed at precisely the posted
speed limit, 3 the “set” button was depressed and the ac-
celerator pedal released; at this point the system was ex-
pected to maintain the set speed by regulating the fuel
flow as needed.
addressed by studying the denominator of the transfer
function: no pole should have a positive real component.
There are quite a few techniques that can be applied
to the problem of determining the stability of a particular
system. One simple technique is known as the Routh
test. Consider the s-domain system function (a concept
developed further in Chap. 15)
H(s) =
N(s)
D(s)
The s-polynomial represented by D(s) can be written as
a n s n + a n−1 s n−1 + · · · + a 1 s + a 0 . Without factoring the
polynomial, not much about the poles can be determined
at a glance. If all the coefficients a n . . . a 0 are positive
and nonzero, the Routh procedure has us arrange them in
the following pattern:
a n
a nϪ2
a nϪ4
. . .
a nϪ1
a nϪ3
a nϪ5
. . .

Unfortunately, something else happened instead. The
vehicle speed immediately dropped by about 10 percent,
to which the cruise control electronics responded by
increasing the fuel flow. The two events were not well
matched, so that a few moments later the vehicle speed
overshot the set point—resulting in a sudden (and signif-
icant) drop in fuel flow—which led to a reduction in the
vehicle speed. The cycle continued to the consternation
of the driver, who eventually gave up and turned off the
system.
Clearly the system response was not optimized—in
fact, as built the system was unstable. System stability is
a major engineering concern across a wide variety of
problems (cruise controls, temperature regulators, and
tracking systems, to name but a few), and the techniques
developed in this chapter are invaluable in allowing the
stability of a particular system to be examined.
One of the powerful aspects of working in the s-
domain as made possible by the Laplace transform is that
instead of describing the response of a particular system
through an integrodifferential equation, we can obtain a
system transfer function represented by the ratio of two
s-polynomials. The issue of stability is then easily
(3) Since no cameras were present, nobody can prove otherwise.
We next create a third row by cross-multiplying the two
rows:
a n−1 a n−2 − a n a n−3 a n−1 a n−4 − a n a n−5
a n−1
a n−1
and a fourth row by cross-multiplying the second and
third rows. This process continues until we have n + 1
rows of numerical values. All that remains is to scan
down the leftmost column for changes in sign. The num-
ber of sign changes indicates the number of poles with a
positive real component; any sign changes indicate an
unstable system.
For example, let’s assume the automobile cruise con-
trol system behind the author’s vexation has a system
transfer function with denominator
D(s) = 7s 4 + 4s 3 + s 2 + 13s + 2
All of the coefficients of this fourth-order s-polynomial
are positive and nonzero, so we construct the corre-
sponding Routh table:
7

−21.75
13.37

from which we see two sign changes in the leftmost col-
umn. Thus, the system is in fact unstable (which explains
its failure to perform) as two of its poles have positive
real components.561

can be invaluable; if only the initial and final values are needed for a partic-

This is the mathematical statement of the initial-value theorem. It states
that the initial value of the time function f (t) can be obtained from its
Laplace transform F(s) by first multiplying the transform by s and then let-
ting s approach infinity. Note that the initial value of f (t) we obtain is the
limit from the right.
The initial-value theorem, along with the final-value theorem that we
will consider in a moment, is useful in checking the results of a transforma-
tion or an inverse transformation. For example, when we first calculated the
transform of cos(ω 0 t)u(t), we obtained s/(s 2 + ω 0 2 ). After noting that
f (0 + ) = 1, we can make a partial check on the validity of this result by
applying the initial-value theorem:
lim

and the check is accomplished.
The Final-Value Theorem
The final-valu theorem is not quite as useful as the initial-value theorem,
for it can be used only with a certain class of transforms. In order to deter-
mine whether a transform fits into this class, the denominator of F(s) must
be evaluated to find all values of s for which it is zero, i.e., the poles of
F(s). Only those transforms F(s)whose poles lie entirely within the left half
of the s plane (i.e., σ < 0), except for a simple pole at s = 0, are suitable
for use with the final-value theorem. We again consider the Laplace trans-

By recognizing that f (0 ) is a constant, a comparison of the last two equa-
tions shows us that
lim f (t) = lim [sF(s)]
t→∞
s→0
[31]
which is the final-value theorem. In applying this theorem, it is necessary
to know that f (∞), the limit of f (t) as t becomes infinite, exists or—what
amounts to the same thing—that the poles of F(s) all lie within the left half
of the s plane except for (possibly) a simple pole at the origin. The product
sF(s) thus has all of its poles lying within the left half plane.
EXAMPLE 14.11
Use the final-value theo em to determine f(∞) for the function
(1 − e −at )u(t), where a > 0.
Without even using the final-value theorem, we see immediately that
f (∞) = 1. The transform of f (t) is

The poles of F(s) are s = 0 and s = −a. Thus, the nonzero pole of F(s)
lies in the left-hand s-plane, as we were assured that a > 0; we find that
we may indeed apply the final-value theorem to this function. Multiply-
ing by s and letting s approach zero, we obtain
lim [sF(s)] = lim

which agrees with f (∞).
If f (t) is a sinusoid, however, so that F(s) has poles on the jω axis,
then a blind use of the final-value theorem might lead us to conclude
that the final value is zero. We know, however, that the final value of
either sin ω 0 t or cos ω 0 t is indeterminate. So, beware of jω-axis poles!

CHAPTER 14 COMPLEX FREQUENCY AND THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
The primary topic of this chapter was the Laplace transform, a mathemati-
cal tool for converting well-behaved time-domain functions into frequency-
domain expressions. Before introducing the transform, we first considered
the notion of a complex frequency, which we referred to as s. This conve-
nient term has both a real (σ ) and imaginary (ω) component, so can be writ-
ten as s = σ + jω. In reality, this is shorthand for an exponentially damped
sinusoid, and we noted that several common functions are actually special
cases of this function. Limited circuit analysis can be performed with this
generalized function, but its real purpose was to simply acquaint the reader
with the idea of a so-called complex frequency.
One of the most surprising things is that day-to-day circuit analysis does
not require direct implementation of either the Laplace transform integral or
its corresponding inverse integral! Instead, look-up tables are routinely em-
ployed, and the s-polynomials which result from analyzing circuits in the
s domain are factored into smaller, easily recognizable terms. This works
because each Laplace transform pair is unique. There are several theorems
associated with Laplace transforms which do see daily usage, however.
These include the linearity theorem, the time-differentiation theorem, and
the time-integration theorem. The time-shift as well as initial-value and
final-value theorems are also commonly employed.
The Laplace technique is not restricted to circuit analysis, or even
electrical engineering for that matter. Any system which is described by
integrodifferential equations can make use of the concepts studied in this
chapter. At this stage, however, it is probably best to review the key con-
cepts already discussed, highlighting appropriate examples.
❑ The concept of complex frequency allows us to consider the
exponentially damped and oscillatory components of a function
simultaneously. (Example 14.1)
❑ The complex frequency s = σ + jω is the general case; dc (s = 0),
exponential (ω = 0), and sinusoidal (σ = 0) functions are special
cases.
❑ Analyzing circuits in the s domain results in the conversion of time-
domain integrodifferential equations into frequency-domain algebraic
equations. (Example 14.1)
❑ In circuit analysis problems, we convert time-domain functions into
the frequency domain using the one-sided Laplace transform:
∞
F(s) = 0 − e −st f (t) dt. (Example 14.2)
❑ The inverse Laplace transform converts frequency-domain expressions
into the time domain. However, it is seldom needed due to the
existence of tables listing Laplace transform pairs. (Example 14.3)
❑ The unit-impulse function is a common approximation to pulses with
very narrow widths compared to circuit time constants. It is nonzero
only at a single point, and has unity area.
❑ { f 1 (t) + f 2 (t)} =
{ f 1 (t)} +
{ f 2 (t)}
❑ {k f (t)} = k { f (t)}, k = constant

Inverse transforms are typically found using a combination of partial-
fraction expansion techniques and various operations (Table 14.2) to
simplify s-domain quantities into expressions that can be found in trans-
form tables (such as Table 14.1). (Examples 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.10)
The differentiation and integration theorems allow us to convert inte-
grodifferential equations in the time domain into simple algebraic
equations in the frequency domain. (Examples 14.7, 14.8, 14.9)
The initial-value and final-value theorems are useful when only the
specific values f (t = 0 + ) or f (t → ∞) are desired. (Example 14.11)

KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
Having been introduced to the concept of complex frequency and
to the Laplace transform technique, we now are ready to see the
details of how circuit analysis in the s-domain actually works. As
the reader might suspect, particularly if Chap. 10 has already been
studied, in fact several shortcuts are routinely applied. The first of
these is to create a new way of viewing capacitors and inductors,
so that s-domain nodal and mesh equations can be written directly.
As part of this method, we will learn how to take care to account
for initial conditions. Another “shortcut” is the concept of a circuit
transfer function. This general function can be exploited to predict
the response of a circuit to various inputs, its stability, and even its
frequency-selective response.
15.1
•
Z(s) AND Y(s)
The key concept that makes phasors so useful in the analysis of
sinusoidal steady-state circuits is the transformation of resistors,
capacitors, and inductors into impedances. Circuit analysis then
proceeds using the basic techniques of nodal or mesh analysis, su-
perposition, source transformation, as well as Thévenin or Norton
equivalents. This concept can be extended to the s-domain, since the
sinusoidal steady state is included in s-domain analysis as a special
case (where σ = 0).
Resistors in the Frequency Domain
Let’s begin with the simplest situation: a resistor connected to a
voltage source v(t). Ohm’s law specifies that
v(t) = Ri(t)
Taking the Laplace transform of both sides,
V(s) = RI(s)

Thus, the ratio of the frequency-domain representation of the voltage to the
frequency-domain representation of the current is simply the resistance, R.
Since we are working in the frequency domain, we refer to this quantity as
an impedance for the sake of clarity, but still assign it the unit ohms ( ):

[1]
Just as we found in working with phasors in the sinusoidal steady state, the
impedance of a resistor does not depend on frequency. The admittance Y(s)
of a resistor, defined as the ratio of I(s) to V(s), is simply 1/R; the unit of
admittance is the siemen (S).

(b) The complete model for an inductor in the
frequency domain, consisting of an impedance s L and
a voltage source −Li(0 − ) that incorporates the effects
of nonzero initial conditions on the element.
Inductors in the Frequency Domain
Next, we consider an inductor connected to some time-varying voltage
source v(t), as shown in Fig. 15.1a. Since
di
v(t) = L
dt
taking the Laplace transform of both sides of this equation yields
V(s) = L[sI(s) − i(0 − )]
[2]
We now have two terms: sLI(s) and Li(0 − ). In situations where we have
zero initial energy stored in the inductor (i.e., i(0 − ) = 0), then
V(s) = sLI(s)
so that
Z(s) ≡
V(s)
= sL
I(s)
[3]
Equation [3] may be further simplified if we are only interested in the
sinusoidal steady-state response. It is permissible to neglect the initial con-
ditions in such instances as they only affect the nature of the transient
response. Thus, we substitute s = jω and find
Z( jω) = jωL
as was obtained previously in Chap. 10.
Modeling Inductors in the s-Domain
Although we refer to the quantity in Eq. [3] as the impedance of an induc-
tor, we must remember that it was obtained by assuming zero initial current.
In the more general situation where energy is stored in the element at
t = 0 − , this quantity is not sufficient to represent the inductor in the fre-
quency domain. Fortunately, it is possible to include the initial condition by
modeling an inductor as an impedance in combination with either a voltage
or current source. To do this, we begin by rearranging Eq. [2] as
V(s) = sLI(s) − Li(0 − )
[4]
The second term on the right will be a constant: the inductance L in henrys
multiplied by the initial current i(0 − ) in amperes. The result is a constantSECTION 15.1 Z(s) AND Y(s)
voltage term that is subtracted from the frequency-dependent term sLI(s).
A small leap of intuition at this point leads us to the realization that we can
model a single inductor L as a two-component frequency-domain element,
as shown in Fig. 15.1b.
The frequency-domain inductor model shown in Fig. 15.1b consists of
an impedance sL and a voltage source Li(0 − ). The voltage across the
impedance sL is given by Ohm’s law as sLI(s). Since the two-element com-
bination in Fig. 15.1b is linear, every circuit analysis technique previously
explored can be brought to bear in the s-domain as well. For example, it
is possible to perform a source transformation on the model in order to
obtain an impedance sL in parallel with a current source [−Li(0 − )]/sL =
−i(0 − )/s. This can be verified by taking Eq. [4] and solving for I(s):
V(s) + Li(0 − )
sL
V(s) i(0 − )
+
=
sL
s
I(s) =
[5]
We are once again left with two terms. The first term on the right is simply an
admittance 1/sL times the voltage V(s). The second term on the right is a
current, although it has units of ampere · seconds. Thus, we can model
this equation with two separate components: an admittance 1/sL in parallel
with a current source i(0 − )/s; the resulting model is shown in Fig. 15.2. The
choice of whether to use the model of Fig. 15.1b or that shown in Fig. 15.2 is
usually made depending on which one will result in simpler equations. Note
that although Fig. 15.2 shows the inductor symbol labeled with an admit-
tance Y(s) = 1/sL, it can also be viewed as an impedance Z(s) = sL; again,
the choice of which to use is generally based on personal preference.

A brief comment on units is in order. When we take the Laplace trans-
form of a current i(t), we are integrating over time. Thus, the units of I(s)
are technically ampere·seconds; in a similar fashion, the units of V(s) are
volt·seconds. However, it is the convention to drop the seconds and assign
I(s) the units of amperes, and to measure V(s) in volts. This convention
does not present any problems until we scrutinize an equation such as
Eq. [5], and see a term like i(0 − )/s seemingly in conflict with the units of
I(s) on the left-hand side. Although we will continue to measure these
phasor quantities in “amperes” and “volts,” when checking the units of an
equation to verify algebra, we must remember the seconds!

We begin by first converting the circuit in Fig. 15.3a to its frequency-
domain equivalent, shown in Fig. 15.3b; the inductor has been replaced
with a two-component model: an impedance sL = 2s , and an inde-
pendent voltage source −Li(0 − ) = −2 V.
We seek the quantity labeled V(s), as its inverse transform will
result in v(t). Note that V(s) appears across the entire inductor model,
and not just the impedance component.

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides results in
I(s) = C[sV(s) − v(0 − )]
or
I(s) = sCV(s) − Cv(0 − )
[6]
which can be modeled as an admittance sC in parallel with a current source
Cv(0 − ) as shown in Fig. 15.5b. Performing a source transformation on this
circuit (taking care to follow the passive sign convention) results in an
equivalent model for the capacitor consisting of an impedance 1/sC in
series with a voltage source v(0 − )/s, as shown in Fig. 15.5c.
In working with these s-domain equivalents, we should be careful not to
be confused with the independent sources being used to include initial
conditions. The initial condition for an inductor is given as i(0 − ); this term
may appear as part of either a voltage source or a current source, depending
on which model is chosen. The initial condition for a capacitor is given as
v(0 − ); this term may thus appear as part of either a voltage source or a576

analysis for the first time is to always use v(0 − ) for the voltage source
component of the model, even when dealing with an inductor.

CHAPTER 15 CIRCUIT ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
15.2 NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
•
In Chap. 10, we learned how to transform time-domain circuits driven by
sinusoidal sources into their frequency-domain equivalents. The benefits of
this transformation were immediately evident, as we were no longer required
to solve integrodifferential equations. Nodal and mesh analysis of such
circuits (restricted to determining only the steady-state response) resulted in
algebraic expressions in terms of jω, ω being the frequency of the sources.
We have now seen that the concept of impedance can be extended to the
more general case of complex frequency (s = σ + jω). Once we transform
circuits from the time domain into the frequency domain, performing nodal
or mesh analysis will once again result in purely algebraic expressions, this
time in terms of the complex frequency s. Solution of the resulting equa-
tions requires the use of variable substitution, Cramer’s rule, or software
capable of symbolic algebra manipulation (e.g., MATLAB). In this section,
we present two examples of reasonable complexity so that we may examine
these issues in greater detail. First, however, we consider how MATLAB
can be used to assist us in such endeavors.
COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
In Chap. 14, we saw that MATLAB can be used to determine the
residues of rational functions in the s-domain, making the inverse
Laplace transform process significantly easier. However, the software
package is actually much more powerful, having numerous built-in
routines for manipulation of algebraic expressions. In fact, as we will
see in this example, MATLAB is even capable of performing inverse
Laplace transforms directly from the rational functions we obtain
through circuit analysis.
Let’s begin by seeing how MATLAB can be used to work with alge-
braic expressions. These expressions are stored as character strings,
with the apostrophe symbol (‘) used in the defining expression. For ex-
ample, we previously represented the polynomial p(s) = s 3 − 12s + 6
as a vector:
EDU» p
[1
0 −12 6];
However, we can also represent it symbolically:
EDU» p
‘sˆ3 − 12*s + 6’;
These two representations are not equal in MATLAB; they are two
distinct concepts. When we wish to manipulate an algebraic expression
symbolically, the second representation is necessary. This ability is
especially useful in working with simultaneous equations.
Consider the set of equations
4
(3s + 10)I 1 − 10I 2 =
s + 2
2
−10I 1 + (4s + 10)I 2 = −
s + 1SECTION 15.2 NODAL AND MESH ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
Using MATLAB’s symbolic notation, we define two string variables:
EDU» eqn1 ‘(3*s+10)*I1 − 10*I2
EDU» eqn2 ‘−10*I1 + (4*s+10)*I2
4/(s+2)’;
−2/(s+1)’;
Note that the entire equation has been included in each string; our goal
is to solve the two equations for the variables I1 and I2. MATLAB
provides a special routine, solve(), that can manipulate the equations for
us. It is invoked by listing the separate equations (defined as strings),
followed by a list of the unknowns (also defined as strings):
EDU» solution
solve(eqn1, eqn2, ‘I1’, ‘I2’);
The answer is stored in the variable solution, although in a somewhat
unexpected form. MATLAB returns the answer in what is termed a struc-
ture, a construct that will be familiar to C programmers. At this stage,
however, all we need to know is how to extract our answer. If we type
EDU» I1
solution.I1
we obtain the response
I1
2*(4*s+9)/(s+1)/(6*sˆ2+47*s+70)
indicating that an s-polynomial expression has been assigned to the
variable I1; a similar operation is used for the variable I2.
We can now proceed directly to determining the inverse Laplace
transform using the function ilaplace():
EDU» i1 ilaplace(I1)
i1
10/29*exp(−t)−172/667*exp(−35/6*t)−2/23*exp(−2*t)
In this manner, we can quickly obtain the solution to simultaneous
equations resulting from nodal or mesh analysis, and also obtain the
inverse Laplace transforms. The command ezplot(i1) allows us to see
what the solution looks like, if we’re so inclined. It should be noted that
complicated expressions sometimes may confuse MATLAB; in such
situations, ilaplace() may not return a useful answer.
It is worth mentioning a few related functions, as they can also be
used to quickly check answers obtained by hand. The function numden()
converts a rational function into two separate variables: one containing
the numerator, and the other containing the denominator. For example,
EDU» [N,D]
numden(I1)
returns two algebraic expressions stored in N and D, respectively:
N
8*s+18
D
(s+1)*(6*sˆ2+47*s+70)
(Continued on next page)
579580
CHAPTER 15 CIRCUIT ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
In order to apply our previous experience with the function residue(),
we need to convert each symbolic (string) expression into a vector
containing the coefficients of the polynomial. This is achieved using
the command sym2poly():
EDU» n
sym2poly(N);
and
EDU» d sym2poly(D)
d

−0.2579 −5.8333 [ ]
−0.0870 −2.0000
0.3448 −1.0000
which is in agreement with what we obtained using ilaplace().
With these new MATLAB skills, (or a deep-seated desire to try an alter-
native approach such as Cramer’s rule or direct substitution), we are ready
to proceed to analyze a few circuits.

The first step is to draw the corresponding s-domain circuit. We see that
the 12 F capacitor has an initial voltage of 2 V across it at t = 0 − ,
requiring that we employ one of the two models of Fig. 15.5. Since we
are to use nodal analysis, perhaps the model of Fig. 15.5b is the better
route. The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 15.10.

ADDITIONAL CIRCUIT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES
Depending on the specific goal in analyzing a particular circuit, we often
find that we can simplify our task by carefully choosing our analysis
technique. For example, it is seldom desirable to apply superposition to a
circuit containing 215 independent sources, as such an approach requires
analysis of 215 separate circuits! By treating passive elements such as ca-
pacitors and inductors as impedances, however, we are free to employ any
of the circuit analysis techniques studied in Chaps. 3, 4, and 5 to circuits that
have been transformed to their s-domain equivalents.
Thus, superposition, source transformations, Thévenin’s theorem, and
Norton’s theorem all apply in the s-domain.
EXAMPLE 15.6
Simplify the circuit of Fig. 15.14a using source transformations,
and determine an expression for the voltage v(t).
0.5 F
With no initial currents or voltages specified, and a u(t) multiplying the
voltage source, we conclude that there is no energy initially stored in
the circuit. Thus, we draw the frequency-domain circuit as shown in
Fig. 15.14b.
Our strategy will be to perform several source transformations in
succession in order to combine the two 2/s impedances and the 10
resistor; we must leave the 9s impedance alone as the desired quan-
tity V(s) appears across its terminals. We may now transform the
voltage source and the leftmost 2/s impedance into a current source

We are being asked to determine the Thévenin equivalent of the circuit
connected to the input device; this quantity is often referred to as the
input impedance of the amplifier circuit. After converting the circuit
to its frequency-domain equivalent, we replace the input device (v s and
R s ) with a 1 A “test” source, as shown in Fig. 15.17b. The input imped-
ance Z in is then
Z in =

or simply V in . We must find an expression for this quantity in terms of
the 1 A source, resistors and capacitors, and/or the dependent source
parameter g.

This particular circuit is known as the “hybrid π ” model
for a special type of single-transistor circuit known as
the common base amplifier. The two capacitors, C π and
C μ , represent capacitances internal to the transistor,
and are typically on the order of a few pF. The resistor
R L in the circuit represents the Thévenin equivalent
resistance of the output device, which could be a
speaker or even a semiconductor laser. The voltage
source v s and the resistor R s together represent the
Thévenin equivalent of the input device, which may be
a microphone, a light-sensitive resistor, or possibly a

where H(s) is the transfer function of the circuit, defined as the ratio of the
output to the input. We could just as easily specify a particular current as
either the input or output quantity, leading to a different transfer function for
the same circuit. Circuit schematics are typically read from left to right, so
designers often place the input of a circuit on the left of the schematic and the
output terminals on the right, at least to the extent where it is possible.
The concept of a transfer function is very important, both in terms of cir-
cuit analysis as well as in other areas of engineering. There are two reasons
for this. First, once we know the transfer function of a particular circuit, we
can easily find the output that results from any input. All we need to do is
multiply H(s) by the input quantity, and take the inverse transform of the
resulting expression. Second, the form of the transfer function contains a
great deal of information about the behavior we might expect from a partic-
ular circuit (or system).
As alluded to in the Practical Application of Chap. 14, in order to eval-
uate the stability of a system it is necessary to determine the poles and zeros
of the transfer function H(s); we will explore this issue in detail shortly.
Writing Eq. [7] as
H(s) =
1/RC
s + 1/RC
[8]
we see that the magnitude of this function approaches zero as s → ∞. Thus,
we say that H(s) has a zero at s = ∞. The function approaches infinity atSECTION 15.5 CONVOLUTION
s = −1/RC; we therefore say that H(s) has a pole at s = −1/RC . These
frequencies are termed critical frequencies, and their early identification sim-
plifies the construction of the response curves we will develop in Sec. 15.7.
15.5
•
CONVOLUTION
The s-domain techniques we have developed up to this point are very use-
ful in determining the current and voltage response of a particular circuit.
However, in practice we are often faced with circuits to which arbitrary
sources can be connected, and require an efficient means of determining the
new output each time. This is easily accomplished if we can characterize the
basic circuit by a transfer function called the system function.
The analysis can proceed in either the time domain or the frequency do-
main, although it is generally more useful to work in the frequency domain.
In such situations, we have a simple four-step process:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Determine the circuit system function (if not already known);
Obtain the Laplace transform of the forcing function to be applied;
Multiply this transform and the system function; and finally
Perform an inverse transform operation on the product to find the
output.
By these means some relatively complicated integral expressions will be
reduced to simple functions of s, and the mathematical operations of inte-
gration and differentiation will be replaced by the simpler operations of
algebraic multiplication and division.
The Impulse Response
Consider a linear electrical network N, without initial stored energy, to which
a forcing function x(t) is applied. At some point in this circuit, a response
function y(t) is present. We show this in block diagram form in Fig. 15.20a
along with sketches of generic time functions. The forcing function is shown
to exist only in the interval a < t < b. Thus, y(t) exists only for t > a.
The question that we now wish to answer is this: “If we know the form
of x(t), how is y(t) described?” To answer this question, we need to know
something about N, such as its response when the forcing function is a unit
impulse δ(t). That is, we are assuming that we know h(t), the response
function resulting when a unit impulse is supplied as the forcing function at
t = 0, as shown in Fig. 15.20b. The function h(t) is commonly called the
unit-impulse response function, or the impulse response.
Based on our knowledge of Laplace transforms, we can view this from
a slightly different perspective. Transforming x(t) into X(s) and y(t) into
Y(s), we define the system transfer function H(s) as
H(s) ≡
Y(s)
X(s)

■ FIGURE 15.20 A conceptual development of the convolution integral.
If x(t) = δ(t), then according to Table 14.1, X(s) = 1. Thus, H(s) = Y(s)
and so in this instance h(t) = y(t).
Instead of applying the unit impulse at time t = 0, let us now suppose
that it is applied at time t = λ (lambda). We see that the only change in the
output is a time delay. Thus, the output becomes h(t − λ) when the input
is δ(t − λ), as shown in Fig. 15.20c. Next, suppose that the input impulse
has some strength other than unity. Specifically, let the strength of the im-
pulse be numerically equal to the value of x(t) when t = λ. This value x(λ)
is a constant; we know that the multiplication of a single forcing function in
a linear circuit by a constant simply causes the response to change propor-
tionately. Thus, if the input is changed to x(λ)δ(t − λ), then the response
becomes x(λ)h(t − λ), as shown in Fig. 15.20d.
Now let us sum this latest input over all possible values of λ and use the
result as a forcing function for N . Linearity decrees that the output must be
equal to the sum of the responses resulting from the use of all possible val-
ues of λ. Loosely speaking, the integral of the input produces the integral of
the output, as shown in Fig. 15.20e. But what is the input now? Given the
sifting property 1 of the unit impulse, we see that the input is simply x(t), the
original input. Thus, Fig. 15.20e may be represented as in Fig. 15.20f.
(1) The sifting property of the impulse function, described in Section 14.5, states that

−∞ f (t)δ(t − t 0 ) dt = f (t 0 ).591
SECTION 15.5 CONVOLUTION
The Convolution Integral
If the input to our system N is the forcing function x(t), we know the output
must be the function y(t) as depicted in Fig. 15.20a. Thus, from Fig. 15.20f
we conclude that
y(t) =
∞
−∞
x(λ)h(t − λ) dλ
[9]
where h(t) is the impulse response of N . This important relationship is
known far and wide as the convolution integral. In words, this last equation
states that the output is equal to the input convolved with the impulse
response. It is often abbreviated by means of
Be careful not to confuse this new notation with
multiplication!
y(t) = x(t) ∗ h(t)
where the asterisk is read “convolved with.”
Equation [9] sometimes appears in a slightly different but equivalent
form. If we let z = t − λ, then dλ = −dz, and the expression for y(t)
becomes
y(t) =
−∞
∞
−x(t − z)h(z) dz =

x(t − z)h(z) dz

Convolution and Realizable Systems
The result that we have in Eq. [10] is very general; it applies to any linear
system. However, we are usually interested in physically realizable
systems, those that do exist or could exist, and such systems have a property
that modifies the convolution integral slightly. That is, the response of the
system cannot begin before the forcing function is applied. In particular,
h(t) is the response of the system resulting from the application of a unit
impulse at t = 0. Therefore, h(t) cannot exist for t < 0. It follows that, in
the second integral of Eq. [10], the integrand is zero when z < 0; in the first
integral, the integrand is zero when (t − z) is negative, or when z > t .
Therefore, for realizable systems the limits of integration change in the
convolution integrals:

Graphical Method of Convolution
Before discussing the significance of the impulse response of a circuit any
further, let us consider a numerical example that will give us some insight
into just how the convolution integral can be evaluated. Although the ex-
pression itself is simple enough, the evaluation is sometimes troublesome,
especially with regard to the values used as the limits of integration.
Suppose that the input is a rectangular voltage pulse that starts at t = 0,
has a duration of 1 second, and is 1 V in amplitude:
x(t) = v i (t) = u(t) − u(t − 1)
(b)
v i (t – z)
Suppose also that this voltage pulse is applied to a circuit whose impulse
response is known to be an exponential function of the form:

h(t) = 2e −t u(t)

■ FIGURE 15.21 Graphical concepts in evaluating a
convolution integral.
Obtaining this expression for v o (t) is simple enough, but the presence of the
many unit-step functions tends to make its evaluation confusing and possi-
bly even a little obnoxious. Careful attention must be paid to the determina-
tion of those portions of the range of integration in which the integrand
is zero.
Let us use some graphical assistance to help us understand what the con-
volution integral says. We begin by drawing several z axes lined up one
above the other, as shown in Fig. 15.21. We know what v i (t) looks like, and
so we know what v i (z) looks like also; this is plotted as Fig. 15.21a. The
function v i (−z) is simply v i (z) run backward with respect to z, or rotated
about the ordinate axis; it is shown in Fig. 15.21b. Next we wish to repre-
sent v i (t − z), which is v i (−z) after it is shifted to the right by an amount
z = t as shown in Fig. 15.21c. On the next z axis, in Fig. 15.21d, our
impulse response h(z) = 2e −z u(z) is plotted.
The next step is to multiply the two functions v i (t − z) and h(z); the re-
sult for an arbitrary value of t < 1 is shown in Fig. 15.21e. We are after a
value for the output v o (t), which is given by the area under the product
curve (shown shaded in the figure).
First consider t < 0. There is no overlap between v i (t − z) and h(z), so
v o = 0. As we increase t, we slide the pulse shown in Fig. 15.21c to the
right, leading to an overlap with h(z) once t > 0. The area under the corre-
sponding curve of Fig. 15.21e continues to increase as we increase the value
of t until we reach t = 1. As t increases above this value, a gap opens up
between z = 0 and the leading edge of the pulse, as shown in Fig. 15.21f. As
a result, the overlap with h(z) decreases.SECTION 15.5 CONVOLUTION

In other words, for values of t that lie between zero and unity, we must
integrate from z = 0 to z = t ; for values of t that exceed unity, the range of
integration is t − 1 < z < t . Thus, we may write

It is now possible to visualize the product of the first graph, x(z),
and the last, h(t − z), for the various ranges of t. When t is less than
zero, there is no overlap, and
y(t) = 0

with x(z) from z = 0 to z = t , and each is unity in value. Thus,

Convolution and the Laplace Transform
Convolution has applications in a wide variety of disciplines beyond linear
circuit analysis, including image processing, communications, and semi-
conductor transport theory. It is often helpful therefore to have a graphical
intuition of the basic process, even if the integral expressions of Eqs. [10]
and [11] are not always the best solution route. One powerful alternative
approach makes use of properties of the Laplace transform—hence our in-
troduction to convolution in this chapter.
Let F 1 (s) and F 2 (s) be the Laplace transforms of f 1 (t) and f 2 (t), respec-
tively, and consider the Laplace transform of f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t),
∞
{ f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t)} =
f 1 (λ) f 2 (t − λ) dλ
−∞
One of these time functions will typically be the forcing function that is
applied at the input terminals of a linear circuit, and the other will be the
unit-impulse response of the circuit.
Since we are now dealing with time functions that do not exist prior to
t = 0 − (the definition of the Laplace transform forces us to assume this), the
lower limit of integration can be changed to 0 − . Then, using the definition
of the Laplace transform, we get
{ f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t)} =
∞
0 −
∞
e −st
0 −
f 1 (λ) f 2 (t − λ) dλ dt
Since e −st does not depend upon λ, we can move this factor inside the
inner integral. If we do this and also reverse the order of integration, the
result is
{ f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t)} =
∞
0 −
∞
0 −
e −st f 1 (λ) f 2 (t − λ) dt dλ
Continuing with the same type of trickery, we note that f 1 (λ) does not
depend upon t, and so it can be moved outside the inner integral:

∞

we may treat λ as a constant):

Since the remaining integral is simply F 1 (s), we find that
{ f 1 (t) ∗ f 2 (t)} = F 1 (s) · F 2 (s)
[12]
Stated slightly differently, we may conclude that the inverse transform
of the product of two transforms is the convolution of the individual inverse
transforms, a result that is sometimes useful in obtaining inverse transforms.
EXAMPLE 15.9
Find v(t) by applying convolution techniques, given that V(s) =
1/[(s + α) (s + β)].
We obtained the inverse transform of this particular function in
Sec. 14.5 using a partial-fraction expansion. We now identify V(s) as
the product of two transforms,
V 1 (s) = 1

V 2 (s) = 1

and
where

or, more compactly,
v(t) =

which is the same result that we obtained before using partial-fraction
expansion. Note that it is necessary to insert the unit step u(t) in the
result because all (one-sided) Laplace transforms are valid only for
nonnegative time.

Was the result easier to obtain by this method? Not
unless one is in love with convolution integrals! The
partial-fraction-expansion method is usually simpler,
assuming that the expansion itself is not too cumber-
some. However, the operation of convolution is easier
to perform in the s-domain, since it only requires
multiplication.
●
15.10 Repeat Example 15.8, performing the convolution in the s-domain.
Further Comments on Transfer Functions
As we have noted several times before, the output v o (t) at some point in a
linear circuit can be obtained by convolving the input v i (t) with the unit-
impulse response h(t). However, we must remember that the impulse
response results from the application of a unit impulse at t = 0 with all initial
conditions zero. Under these conditions, the Laplace transform of v o (t) is
{v o (t)} = V o (s) =
{v i (t) ∗ h(t)} = V i (s)[ {h(t)}]
Thus, the ratio V o (s)/V i (s) is equal to the transform of the impulse re-
sponse, which we shall denote by H(s),
V o (s)
{h(t)} = H(s) =
[13]
V i (s)
From Eq. [13] we see that the impulse response and the transfer function
make up a Laplace transform pair,
h(t) ⇔ H(s)
This is an important fact that we shall explore further in Sec. 15.7, after
becoming familiar with the concept of pole-zero plots and the complex-
frequency plane. At this point, however, we are already able to exploit this
new concept of convolution for circuit analysis.

■ FIGURE 15.28 The complex-frequency plane, also

As evident in the last several examples, circuits with even a comparatively
small number of elements can lead to rather unwieldy s-domain expres-
sions. In such instances, a graphical representation of a particular circuit
response or transfer function can provide useful insights. In this section, we
introduce one such technique, based on the idea of the complex-frequency
plane (Fig. 15.28). Complex frequency has two components (σ and ω), so we
are naturally drawn to representing our functions using a three-dimensional
model.
Since ω represents an oscillating function, there is no physical distinc-
tion between a positive and negative frequency. In the case of σ , however,
which can be identified with an exponential term, positive values are in-
creasing in magnitude, whereas negative values are decaying. The origin of
the s plane corresponds to dc (no time variation). A pictorial summary of
these ideas is presented in Fig. 15.29.SECTION 15.6 THE COMPLEX-FREQUENCY PLANE

as would be represented on the complex-frequency plane. When ω = 0, a function will have no
oscillatory component; when σ = 0, the function is purely sinusoidal except when ω is also zero.
To construct an appropriate three-dimensional representation of some
function F(s), we first note that we have its magnitude in mind, although the
phase will have a strong complex-frequency dependence as well and may
be graphed in a similar fashion. Thus, we will begin by substituting σ + jω
for s in our function F(s), then proceed to determine an expression for
|F(s)|. We next draw an axis perpendicular to the s plane, and use this to
plot |F(s)| for each value of σ and ω. The basic process is illustrated in the
following example.
EXAMPLE 15.11
Sketch the admittance of the series combination of a 1 H inductor
and a 3 resistor as a function of both jω and σ.
The admittance of these two series elements is given by

|Y(s)| =

(σ + 3) 2 + ω 2
(Continued on next page)600
CHAPTER 15 CIRCUIT ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
When s = −3 + j0, the response magnitude is infinite; when s is
infinite, the magnitude of Y(s) is zero. Thus our model must have infi-
nite height over the point (−3 + j0), and it must have zero height at all
points infinitely far away from the origin. A cutaway view of such a
model is shown in Fig. 15.30a.

Once the model is constructed, it is simple to visualize the variation
of |Y| as a function of ω (with σ = 0) by cutting the model with a
perpendicular plane containing the jω axis. The model shown in
Fig. 15.30a happens to be cut along this plane, and the desired plot of
|Y| versus ω can be seen; the curve is also drawn in Fig. 15.30b. In a
similar manner, a vertical plane containing the σ axis enables us to
obtain |Y| versus σ (with ω = 0), as shown in Fig. 15.30c.

Pole-Zero Constellations
This approach works well for relatively simple functions, but a more prac-
tical method is needed in general. Let us visualize the s plane once again asSECTION 15.6 THE COMPLEX-FREQUENCY PLANE
the floor and then imagine a large elastic sheet laid on it. We now fix our
attention on all the poles and zeros of the response. At each zero, the re-
sponse is zero, the height of the sheet must be zero, and we therefore tack
the sheet to the floor. At the value of s corresponding to each pole, we may
prop up the sheet with a thin vertical rod. Zeros and poles at infinity must be
treated by using a large-radius clamping ring or a high circular fence, re-
spectively. If we have used an infinitely large, weightless, perfectly elastic
sheet, tacked down with vanishingly small tacks, and propped up with infi-
nitely long, zero-diameter rods, then the elastic sheet assumes a height that
is exactly proportional to the magnitude of the response.
These comments may be illustrated by considering the configuration of
the poles and zeros, sometimes called a pole-zero constellation, that locates
all the critical frequencies of a frequency-domain quantity, for example, an
impedance Z(s). A pole-zero constellation for an example impedance is
shown in Fig. 15.32; in such a diagram, poles are denoted by crosses and
zeros by circles. If we visualize an elastic-sheet model, tacked down at
s = −2 + j0 and propped up at s = −1 + j5 and at s = −1 − j5, we
should see a terrain whose distinguishing features are two mountains and
one conical crater or depression. The portion of the model for the upper

In order to determine k, we require a value for Z(s) at some s other than
a critical frequency. For this function, let us suppose we are told Z(0) 1.

NATURAL RESPONSE AND THE s PLANE
At the beginning of this chapter, we explored how working in the frequency
domain through the Laplace transform allows us to consider a broad
range of time-varying circuits, discarding integrodifferential equations and
working algebraically instead. This approach is very powerful, but it
does suffer from not being a very visual process. In contrast, there is
a tremendous amount of information contained in the pole-zero plot of a
forced response. In this section, we consider how such plots can be used
to obtain the complete response of a circuit—natural plus forced—provided
the initial conditions are known. The advantage of such an approach is a
more intuitive linkage between the location of the critical frequencies,
easily visualized through the pole-zero plot, and the desired response.
Let us introduce the method by considering the simplest example, a se-
ries R L circuit as shown in Fig. 15.33. A general voltage source v s (t)
causes the current i(t) to flow after closure of the switch at t = 0. The com-
plete response i(t) for t > 0 is composed of a natural response and a forced
response:
i(t) = i n (t) + i f (t)
We may find the forced response by working in the frequency domain, as-
suming, of course, that v s (t) has a functional form that we can transform to
the frequency domain; if v s (t) = 1/(1 + t 2 ), for example, we must proceed
as best we can from the basic differential equation for the circuit. For the
circuit of Fig. 15.33, we have
V s
I f (s) =
R + sL
or

V s
I f (s) =
[16]
L s + R/L603
SECTION 15.7 NATURAL RESPONSE AND THE s PLANE
Next we consider the natural response. From previous experience, we
know that the form will be a decaying exponential with the time constant
L/R, but let’s pretend that we are finding it for the first time. The form of
the natural (source-free) response is, by definition, independent of the forc-
ing function; the forcing function contributes only to the magnitude of the
natural response. To find the proper form, we turn off all independent
sources; here, v s (t) is replaced by a short circuit. Next, we try to obtain the
natural response as a limiting case of the forced response. Returning to the
frequency-domain expression of Eq. [16], we obediently set V s = 0. On
the surface, it appears that I(s) must also be zero, but this is not necessarily
true if we are operating at a complex frequency that is a simple pole of I(s).
That is, the denominator and the numerator may both be zero so that I(s)
need not be zero.
Let us inspect this new idea from a slightly different vantage point. We
fix our attention on the ratio of the desired forced response to the forcing
function. We designate this ratio H(s) and define it to be the circuit transfer
function. Then,
I f (s)
1
= H(s) =
V s
L(s + R/L)
In this example, the transfer function is the input admittance faced by V s .
We seek the natural (source-free) response by setting V s = 0. However,
I f (s) = V s H(s), and if V s = 0, a nonzero value for the current can be
obtained only by operating at a pole of H(s). The poles of the transfer func-
tion therefore assume a special significance.
In this particular example, we see that the pole of the transfer function
occurs at s = −R/L + j0, as shown in Fig. 15.34. If we choose to operate
at this particular complex frequency, the only finit current that could result
must be a constant in the s-domain (i.e., frequency-independent). We thus
obtain the natural response
I s =−
What does it mean to “operate” at a complex
frequency? How could we possibly accomplish such a
thing in a real laboratory? In this instance, it is important
to remember how we invented complex frequency to
begin with: it is a means of describing a sinusoidal
function of frequency ω multiplied by an exponential
function e σ t . Such types of signals are very easy to
generate with real (i.e., nonimaginary) laboratory equip-
ment. Thus, we need only set the value for σ and the
value for ω in order to “operate” at s = σ + jω.
R
+ j0 = A
L
where A is an unknown constant. We next desire to transform this natural
response to the time domain. Our knee-jerk reaction might be to attempt
to apply inverse Laplace transform techniques in this situation. However,
we have already specified a value of s, so that such an approach is not
valid. Instead, we look to the real part of our general function e st ,
such that
j␻
i n (t) = Re{Ae st } = Re{Ae −Rt/L }
In this case we find
i n (t) = Ae −Rt/L
so that the total response is then
i(t) = Ae −Rt/L + i f (t)
–R/L

CHAPTER 15 CIRCUIT ANALYSIS IN THE s-DOMAIN
and A may be determined once the initial conditions are specified for this
circuit. The forced response i f (t) is obtained by finding the inverse Laplace
transform of I f (s).
A More General Perspective
Figure 15.35 shows single sources connected to networks containing no
independent sources. The desired response, which might be some current
I 1 (s) or some voltage V 2 (s), may be expressed by a transfer function that
displays all the critical frequencies. To be specific, we select the response
V 2 (s) in Fig. 15.35a:
V 2 (s)
(s − s 1 )(s − s 3 ) · · ·
= H(s) = k
V s
(s − s 2 )(s − s 4 ) · · ·
[17]
The poles of H(s) occur at s = s 2 , s 4 , . . . , and so a finite voltage V 2 (s) at
each of these frequencies must be a possible functional form for the natural
response. Thus, we think of a zero-volt source (which is just a short-circuit)
applied to the input terminals; the natural response that occurs when the
input terminals are short-circuited must therefore have the form
v 2n (t) = A 2 e s 2 t + A 4 e s 4 t + · · ·
where each A must be evaluated in terms of the initial conditions (including
the initial value of any voltage source applied at the input terminals).
To find the form of the natural response i 1n (t) in Fig. 15.35a, we should
determine the poles of the transfer function, H(s) = I 1 (s)/V s . The transfer
functions applying to the situations depicted in Fig. 15.35b would be
I 1 (s)/I s and V 2 (s)/I s , and their poles then determine the natural responses
i 1n (t) and v 2n (t), respectively.
If the natural response is desired for a network that does not contain any
independent sources, then a source V s or I s may be inserted at any conve-
nient point, restricted only by the condition that the original network is
obtained when the source is set to zero. The corresponding transfer function
is then determined and its poles specify the natural frequencies. Note that
the same frequencies must be obtained for any of the many source locations
possible. If the network already contains a source, that source may be set
equal to zero and another source inserted at a more convenient point.

and some initial energy is available.605
SECTION 15.7 NATURAL RESPONSE AND THE s PLANE
A Special Case
Before we illustrate this method with an example, completeness requires us
to acknowledge a special case that might arise. This occurs when the net-
work in Fig. 15.35a or b contains two or more parts that are isolated from
each other. For example, we might have the parallel combination of three
networks: R 1 in series with C, R 2 in series with L, and a short circuit.
Clearly, a voltage source in series with R 1 and C cannot produce any current
in R 2 and L; that transfer function would be zero. To find the form of the nat-
ural response of the inductor voltage, for example, the voltage source must
be installed in the R 2 L network. A case of this type can often be recognized
by an inspection of the network before a source is installed; but if it is not,
then a transfer function equal to zero will be obtained. When H(s) = 0, we
obtain no information about the frequencies characterizing the natural
response, and a more suitable location for the source must be used.
EXAMPLE 15.12
For the source-free circuit of Fig. 15.36, determine expressions for i 1
and i 2 for t > 0, given the initial conditions i 1 (0) = i 2 (0) = 11 A.
Let us install a voltage source V s between points x and y and find the
transfer function H(s) = I 1 (s)/V s , which also happens to be the input
admittance seen by the voltage source. We have

From recent experience, we know at a glance that i 1 must be of the
form
i 1 (t) = Ae −2t + Be −t/6
The solution is completed by using the given initial conditions to estab-
lish the values of A and B. Since i 1 (0) is given as 11 amperes,
11 = A + B
The necessary additional equation is obtained by writing the KVL

The process that we must pursue to evaluate the amplitude coefficients
of the natural response is a detailed one, except in those cases where the ini-
tial values of the desired response and its derivatives are obvious. However,
we should not lose sight of the ease and rapidity with which the form of the
natural response can be obtained.

A TECHNIQUE FOR SYNTHESIZING THE
out /V in
• VOLTAGE RATIO H(s) = V
Much of the discussion in this chapter has been related to the poles and
zeros of a transfer function. We have located them on the complex-
frequency plane, we have used them to express transfer functions as ratios
of factors or polynomials in s, we have calculated forced responses from
them, and in Sec. 15.7 we have used their poles to establish the form of the
natural response.
Now let us see how we might determine a network that can provide a
desired transfer function. We consider only a small part of the general prob-
lem, working with a transfer function of the form H(s) = V out (s)/V in (s), as
indicated in Fig. 15.41. For simplicity, we restrict H(s) to critical frequen-
cies on the negative σ axis (including the origin). Thus, we will consider
transfer functions such as
H 1 (s) =
10(s + 2)
s + 5PRACTICAL APPLICATION
Design of Oscillator Circuits
At several points throughout this book, we have investi-
gated the behavior of various circuits responding to sinu-
soidal excitation. The creation of sinusoidal waveforms,
however, is an interesting topic in itself. Generation of
large sinusoidal voltages and currents is straightforward
using magnets and rotating coils of wire, for example, but
such an approach is not easily scaled down for creation of
small signals. Instead, low-current applications typically
make use of what is known as an oscillator, which ex-
ploits the concept of positive feedback using an appropri-
ate amplifier circuit. Oscillator circuits are an integral
component of many consumer products, such as the
global positioning satellite (GPS) receiver of Fig. 15.38.
■ FIGURE 15.38 Many consumer electronic products, such as this GPS
receiver, rely on oscillator circuits to provide a reference frequency.

One straightforward but useful oscillator circuit
is known as the Wien-bridge oscillator, shown in
Fig. 15.39.
The circuit resembles a noninverting op amp circuit,
with a resistor R 1 connected between the inverting input
pin and ground, and a resistor R f connected between the
output and the inverting input pin. The resistor R f
supplies what is referred to as a negative feedback path,
since it connects the output of the amplifier to the invert-
ing input. Any increase V o in the output then leads to a
reduction of the input, which in turn leads to a smaller
output; this process increases the stability of the output
voltage V o . The gain of the op amp, defined as the ratio
of V o to V i , is determined by the relative sizes of R 1
and R f .
The positive feedback loop consists of two sepa-
rate resistor-capacitor combinations, defined as Z s =

R + 1/sC and Z p = R (1/sC). The values we choose
for R and C allow us to design an oscillator having a
specific frequency (the internal capacitances of the op
amp itself will limit the maximum frequency that can be
obtained). In order to determine the relationship between
R, C, and the oscillation frequency, we seek an expres-
sion for the amplifier gain, V o /V i .
Recalling the two ideal op amp rules as discussed in
Chap. 6 and examining the circuit in Fig. 15.39 closely,
we recognize that Z p and Z s form a voltage divider such
that
Z p
V i = V o
[18]
Z p + Z s
Simplifying the expressions for Z p = R (1/sC) =
R/(1 + sRC), and Z s = R + 1/sC = (1 + sRC)/sC ,
we find that

1 − ω 2 R 2 C 2 + 3 jωRC
[20]
This expression for the gain is real only when ω =
1/RC . Thus, we can design an amplifier to operate at a
particular frequency f = ω/2π = 1/2π RC by select-
ing values for R and C.
(Continued on next page)As an example, let’s design a Wien-bridge oscillator
to generate a sinusoidal signal at a frequency of 20 Hz,
the commonly accepted lower frequency of the audio
range. We require a frequency ω = 2π f = (6.28)(20) =
125.6 rad/s. Once we specify a value for R, the necessary
value for C is known (and vice versa). Assuming that we
happen to have a 1 μF capacitor handy, we thus compute
a required resistance of R = 7962 . Since this is not a
standard resistor value, we will likely have to use several
resistors in series and/or parallel combinations to obtain
the necessary value. Referring to Fig. 15.39 in prepara-
tion for simulating the circuit using PSpice, however, we
notice that no values for R f or R 1 have been specified.
Although Eq. [18] correctly specifies the relationship
between V o and V i , we may also write another equation
relating these quantities:
0 =
a transient PSpice analysis on the circuit selecting
R f = 2 k and R 1 = 1 k , for example, we will likely
be disappointed in the outcome. In order to ensure that
the circuit is indeed unstable (a necessary condition for
oscillations to begin), it is necessary to have R f /R 1
slightly greater than 2. The simulated output of our final
design (R = 7962 , C = 1 μF, R f = 2.01 k , and
R 1 = 1 k ) is shown in Fig. 15.40. Note that the magni-
tude of the oscillations is increasing in the plot; in
practice, nonlinear circuit elements are required to stabi-
lize the voltage magnitude of the oscillator circuit.

If Z f and Z 1 are both resistances, the circuit acts as an inverting amplifier,
or possibly an attenuator (if the ratio is less than unity). Our present inter-
est, however, lies with those cases in which one of these impedances is a re-
sistance while the other is an RC network.

For our ideal op amps, the output or Thévenin impedance is zero and
therefore V out and V out /V in are not functions of any load Z L that may be
placed across the output terminals. This includes the input to another op
amp as well, and therefore we may connect circuits having poles and zeros
at specified locations in cascade, where the output of one op amp is
connected directly to the input of the next, and thus generates any desired
transfer function.

The pole at s = −5 may be obtained by a network of the form of

SUMMARY AND REVIEW
After having been exposed to the concept of complex frequency in
Chap. 14, we applied that concept to circuit analysis in this chapter. The
first topic was impedance—perhaps familiar to those who have already
read Chap. 10. The concept of impedance (or admittance) allows us to
directly construct s-domain equations which describe nodal voltages, mesh
currents, etc., without having to rely on taking the Laplace transform of
each term of an integrodifferential equation. Somewhat surprisingly, we
found that the impedance of inductors and capacitors includes the initial
condition of that element. From that point forward, all of our familiar
circuit analysis techniques apply. The only difficulty encountered is in fac-
toring higher-order polynomials in order to perform an inverse transform.
We also introduced the notion of a system transfer function, which allows
the input to a network to be changed easily, and the new output predicted.
Working in the s-domain proved very natural here, and we saw that convo-
lution of two time-domain functions is easily performed by multiplying
their s-domain equivalents.611
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
The third major topic of the chapter was the complex-frequency plane,
which allows us to create a graphical representation of any s-domain ex-
pression. In particular, it provides a tidy means for readily identifying poles
and zeros. Since the sources connected to a circuit only determine the mag-
nitude of the transient response, and not the form of the transisent response
itself, we found that s-domain analysis can reveal details about the natural
as well as forced response of a network. We concluded the chapter with a
description of how op amps can be employed to synthesize a desired trans-
fer function, placing poles and zeros where they are needed through cas-
caded stages.
This topic will be revisited in future studies of signal analysis, and the
concept of convolution in particular is applicable to a broad range of appli-
cations. At this stage, however, perhaps we should pause and allow the
reader to focus on key issues and identify relevant examples as a start to re-
viewing what we have discussed.
❑ Resistors may be represented in the frequency domain by an
impedance having the same magnitude. (Example 15.1)
❑ Inductors may be represented in the frequency domain by an
impedance sL. If the initial current is nonzero, then the impedance
must be placed in series with a voltage source −Li(0 − ) or in parallel
with a current source i(0 − )/s. (Example 15.1)
❑ Capacitors may be represented in the frequency domain by an
impedance 1/sC . If the initial voltage is nonzero, then the impedance
must be placed in series with a voltage source v(0 − )/s or in parallel
with a current source Cv(0 − ). (Example 15.2)
❑ Nodal and mesh analysis in the s-domain lead to simultaneous
equations in terms of s-polynomials. MATLAB is a particularly useful
tool for solving such systems of equations. (Examples 15.3, 15.4, 15.5)
❑ Superposition, source transformation, and the Thévenin and Norton
theorems all apply in the s-domain. (Examples 15.6, 15.7)
❑ A circuit transfer function H(s) is defined as the ratio of the s-domain
output to the s-domain input. Either quantity may be a voltage or
current. (Example 15.8)
❑ The zeros of H(s) are those values that result in zero magnitude. The
poles of H(s) are those values that result in infinite magnitude.
❑ Convolution provides us with both an analytic and a graphical means
of determining the output of a circuit from its impulse response h(t).
(Examples 15.8, 15.9, 15.10)
❑ There are several graphical approaches to representing s-domain
expressions in terms of poles and zeros. Such plots can be used to
synthesize a circuit to obtain a desired response. (Example 15.11)
❑ A source-free circuit can be analyzed using s-domain techniques to
determine its transient response.
❑ Single op amp stages can be used to synthesize transfer functions
having either a zero or a pole. More complex functions can be
synthesized by cascading multiple stages.
These models are summarized in Table 15.1.612

16 Frequency Response
KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
We have already been introduced to the concept of frequency
response, meaning that the behavior of our circuit can change
dramatically depending on the frequency (or frequencies) of
operation—a radical departure from our first experiences with
simple dc circuits. In this chapter we take the topic to a more re-
fined level, as even simple circuits designed for specific frequency
response can be enormously useful in a wide variety of everyday
applications. In fact, we make use of frequency-selective circuits
throughout the day, probably without even realizing it. For exam-
ple, switching to our favorite radio station is in fact tuning our
radio to selectively amplify a narrow band of signal frequencies;
heating microwave popcorn is possible while watching television
or talking on a cell phone because the frequencies of each device
can be isolated from one another. In addition, studying frequency
response and filters can be particularly enjoyable as it provides us
with a vehicle for pushing past analysis of existing circuits, and
enabling the design of complex circuits from scratch to meet some-
times stringent specifications. We’ll start this journey with a short
discussion of resonance, loss, quality factor, and bandwidth—
important concepts for filters as well as any circuit (or system, for
that matter) containing energy storage elements.

PARALLEL RESONANCE
Suppose that a certain forcing function is found to contain sinusoidal
components having frequencies within the range of 10 to 100 Hz. Now
let us imagine that this forcing function is applied to a network that
619620
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
has the property that all sinusoidal voltages with frequencies from zero to
200 Hz applied at the input terminals appear doubled in magnitude at the
output terminals, with no change in phase angle. The output function is
therefore an undistorted facsimile of the input function, but with twice the
amplitude. If, however, the network has a frequency response such that the
magnitudes of input sinusoids between 10 and 50 Hz are multiplied by a dif-
ferent factor than are those between 50 and 100 Hz, then the output would
in general be distorted; it would no longer be a magnified version of the in-
put. This distorted output might be desirable in some cases and undesirable
in others. That is, the network frequency response might be chosen deliber-
ately to reject some frequency components of the forcing function, or to
emphasize others.
Such behavior is characteristic of tuned circuits or resonant circuits, as
we will see in this chapter. In discussing resonance we will be able to apply
all the methods we have discussed in presenting frequency response.
Resonance
In this section we will begin the study of a very important phenomenon that
may occur in circuits that contain both inductors and capacitors. The phe-
nomenon is called resonance, and it may be loosely described as the condi-
tion existing in any physical system when a fixed-amplitude sinusoidal
forcing function produces a response of maximum amplitude. However, we
often speak of resonance as occurring even when the forcing function is not
sinusoidal. The resonant system may be electrical, mechanical, hydraulic,
acoustic, or some other kind, but we will restrict our attention, for the most
part, to electrical systems.
Resonance is a familiar phenomenon. Jumping up and down on the
bumper of an automobile, for example, can put the vehicle into rather large
oscillatory motion if the jumping is done at the proper frequency (about one
jump per second), and if the shock absorbers are somewhat decrepit. How-
ever, if the jumping frequency is increased or decreased, the vibrational
response of the automobile will be considerably less than it was before. A
further illustration is furnished in the case of an opera singer who is able to
shatter crystal goblets by means of a well-formed note at the proper fre-
quency. In each of these examples, we are thinking of frequency as being
adjusted until resonance occurs; it is also possible to adjust the size, shape,
and material of the mechanical object being vibrated, but this may not be so
easily accomplished physically.
The condition of resonance may or may not be desirable, depending
upon the purpose which the physical system is to serve. In the automotive
example, a large amplitude of vibration may help to separate locked
bumpers, but it would be somewhat disagreeable at 65 mi/h (105 km/h).
Let us now define resonance more carefully. In a two-terminal electrical
network containing at least one inductor and one capacitor, we define reso-
nance as the condition which exists when the input impedance of the net-
work is purely resistive. Thus,
a network is in resonance (or resonant) when the voltage and current
at the network input terminals are in phase.621
SECTION 16.1 PARALLEL RESONANCE
We will also find that a maximum-amplitude response is produced in the
network when it is in the resonant condition.
We first apply the definition of resonance to a parallel RLC network dri-
ven by a sinusoidal current source as shown in Fig. 16.1. In many practical
situations, this circuit is a very good approximation to the circuit we might
build in the laboratory by connecting a physical inductor in parallel with a
physical capacitor, where the parallel combination is driven by an energy
source having a very high output impedance. The steady-state admittance
offered to the ideal current source is

Resonance occurs when the voltage and current at the input terminals
are in phase. This corresponds to a purely real admittance, so that the nec-
essary condition is given by

The resonant condition may be achieved by adjusting L, C, or ω; we will
devote our attention to the case for which ω is the variable. Hence, the res-
onant frequency ω 0 is

The pole-zero constellation shown in Fig. 16.2a follows directly from the
factored form.
In view of the relationship among α, ω d , and ω 0 , it is apparent that the
distance from the origin of the s plane to one of the admittance zeros is nu-
merically equal to ω 0 . Given the pole-zero configuration, the resonant fre-
quency may therefore be obtained by purely graphical methods. We merely
swing an arc, using the origin of the s plane as a center, through one of the
zeros. The intersection of this arc and the positive jω axis locates the point
s = jω 0 . It is evident that ω 0 is slightly greater than the natural resonant
frequency ω d , but their ratio approaches unity as the ratio of ω d to α in-
creases.

Next let us examine the magnitude of the response, the voltage V(s) indicated
in Fig. 16.1, as the frequency ω of the forcing function is varied. If we assume
a constant-amplitude sinusoidal current source, the voltage response is pro-
portional to the input impedance. This response can be obtained from the

mum value in the vicinity of the natural resonant frequency, and then drops
again to zero as ω becomes infinite. The frequency response is sketched in
Fig. 16.3. The maximum value of the response is indicated as R times the
amplitude of the source current, implying that the maximum magnitude of
the circuit impedance is R; moreover, the response maximum is shown to
occur exactly at the resonant frequency ω 0 . Two additional frequencies, ω 1

curve, are also identified. Let us first show that the maximum impedance
magnitude is R and that this maximum occurs at resonance.
The admittance, as specified by Eq. [1], possesses a constant conduc-
tance and a susceptance which has a minimum magnitude (zero) at reso-
nance. The minimum admittance magnitude therefore occurs at resonance,
and it is 1/R. Hence, the maximum impedance magnitude is R, and it
occurs at resonance.
At the resonant frequency, therefore, the voltage across the parallel reso-
nant circuit of Fig. 16.1 is simply IR, and the entire source current I flows
through the resistor. However, current is also present in L and C. For the
inductor, I L ,0 = V L ,0 /jω 0 L = IR/jω 0 L, and the capacitor current at reso-
nance is I C,0 = ( jω 0 C)V C,0 = jω 0 CRI. Since 1/ω 0 C = ω 0 L at resonance,
we find that
I C,0 = −I L ,0 = jω 0 CRI
[5]
and
I C,0 + I L ,0 = I LC = 0
Thus, the net current flowing into the LC combination is zero. The maxi-
mum value of the response magnitude and the frequency at which it occurs
are not always found so easily. In less standard resonant circuits, we may
find it necessary to express the magnitude of the response in analytical
form, usually as the square root of the sum of the real part squared and the
imaginary part squared; then we should differentiate this expression with
respect to frequency, equate the derivative to zero, solve for the frequency
of maximum response, and finally substitute this frequency in the magni-
tude expression to obtain the maximum-amplitude response. The procedure
may be carried out for this simple case merely as a corroborative exercise;
but, as we have seen, it is not necessary.
Quality Factor
It should be emphasized that, although the height of the response curve of
Fig. 16.3 depends only upon the value of R for constant-amplitude excita-
tion, the width of the curve or the steepness of the sides depends upon the
other two element values also. We will shortly relate the “width of the
response curve” to a more carefully defined quantity, the bandwidth, but it is
helpful to express this relationship in terms of a very important parameter,
the quality factor Q.
We will find that the sharpness of the response curve of any resonant cir-
cuit is determined by the maximum amount of energy that can be stored in
the circuit, compared with the energy that is lost during one complete period
of the response.
We define Q as
Q = quality factor ≡ 2π
maximum energy stored
total energy lost per period
[6]
The proportionality constant 2π is included in the definition in order to sim-
plify the more useful expressions for Q which we will now obtain. Since
We should be very careful not to confuse the quality
factor with charge or reactive power, all of which
unfortunately are represented by the letter Q.624
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
energy can be stored only in the inductor and the capacitor, and can be lost
only in the resistor, we may express Q in terms of the instantaneous energy
associated with each of the reactive elements and the average power P R
dissipated in the resistor:
Q = 2π
[w L (t) + w C (t)] max
P R T
where T is the period of the sinusoidal frequency at which Q is evaluated.
Now let us apply this definition to the parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 16.1
and determine the value of Q at the resonant frequency; this value of Q is
denoted by Q 0 . We select the current forcing function
i(t) = I m cos ω 0 t
and obtain the corresponding voltage response at resonance,
v(t) = Ri(t) = RI m cos ω 0 t
The energy stored in the capacitor is then
w C (t) =
1 2 I 2 m R 2 C
Cv =
cos 2 ω 0 t

and the instantaneous energy stored in the inductor is given by
w L (t) =

so that
w L (t) =
I 2 m R 2 C
sin 2 ω 0 t
2
The total instantaneous stored energy is therefore constant:
I 2 m R 2 C
2
and this constant value must also be the maximum value. In order to find the
energy lost in the resistor in one period, we take the average power absorbed
by the resistor (see Sec. 11.2),
w(t) = w L (t) + w C (t) =
P R = 12 I 2 m R
and multiply by one period, obtaining
P R T =
1 2
I R
2 f 0 m
We thus find the quality factor at resonance:
Q 0 = 2π
I 2 m R 2 C/2
I 2 m R/2 f 0
or
Q 0 = 2π f 0 RC = ω 0 RC
[7]
This equation (as well as any expression in Eq. [8]) holds only for the sim-
ple parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 16.1. Equivalent expressions for Q 0 whichSECTION 16.1 PARALLEL RESONANCE
are often quite useful may be obtained by simple substitution:
Q 0 = R
C
R

|X C,0 |
|X L ,0 |
[8]
So we see that for this specific circuit, decreasing the resistance de-
creases Q 0 ; the lower the resistance, the greater the amount of energy lost
in the element. Intriguingly, increasing the capacitance increases Q 0 , but
increasing the inductance leads to a reduction in Q 0 . These statements, of
course, apply to operation of the circuit at the resonant frequency.
Other Interpretations of Q
Another useful interpretation of Q is obtained when we inspect the inductor
and capacitor currents at resonance, as given by Eq. [5],
I C,0 = −I L ,0 = jω 0 CRI = jQ 0 I
[9]
Note that each is Q 0 times the source current in amplitude and that each is
180 ◦ out of phase with the other. Thus, if we apply 2 mA at the resonant fre-
quency to a parallel resonant circuit with a Q 0 of 50, we find 2 mA in the
resistor, and 100 mA in both the inductor and the capacitor. A parallel reso-
nant circuit can therefore act as a current amplifier, but not, of course, as a
power amplifier, since it is a passive network.
Resonance, by definition, is fundamentally associated with the forced
response, since it is defined in terms of a (purely resistive) input impedance,
a sinusoidal steady-state concept. The two most important parameters of a
resonant circuit are perhaps the resonant frequency ω 0 and the quality fac-
tor Q 0 . Both the exponential damping coefficient and the natural resonant
frequency may be expressed in terms of ω 0 and Q 0 :

write this factor in a slightly different form that utilizes the dimensionless
parameter ζ (zeta), called the damping factor:

energy loss, and hence the resistance in our circuit. Rearranging the
expression in Eq. [8], we calculate

|Y(ω 0 )| = 4.472 × 10 −4 S
|Y(1.1ω 0 )| = 6.182 × 10 −4 S
We thus obtain a minimum impedance at the resonant frequency, or a
maximum voltage response to a particular input current. If we quickly
compute the reactance at these three frequencies, we find
X (0.9ω 0 ) = −4.72 × 10 −4 S
X (1.1ω 0 ) = 4.72 × 10 −4 S
X (ω 0 ) = −1.36 × 10 −7
We leave it to the reader to show that our value for X (ω 0 ) is nonzero
only as a result of rounding error.627

;
Now let us interpret Q 0 in terms of the pole-zero locations of the ad-
mittance Y(s) of the parallel RLC circuit. We will keep ω 0 constant; this
may be done, for example, by changing R while holding L and C con-
stant. As Q 0 is increased, the relationships relating α, Q 0 , and ω 0 indicate
that the two zeros must move closer to the jω axis. These relationships
also show that the zeros must simultaneously move away from the σ axis.
The exact nature of the movement becomes clearer when we remember
that the point at which s = jω 0 could be located on the jω axis by swing-
ing an arc, centered at the origin, through one of the zeros and over to the
positive jω axis; since ω 0 is to be held constant, the radius must be con-
stant, and the zeros must therefore move along this arc toward the positive
jω axis as Q 0 increases.
The two zeros are indicated in Fig. 16.4, and the arrows show the path
they take as R increases. When R is infinite, Q 0 is also infinite, and the two
zeros are found at s = ± jω 0 on the jω axis. As R decreases, the zeros
move toward the σ axis along the circular locus, joining to form a double
zero on the σ axis at s = −ω 0 when R = 12 L/C or Q 0 = 12 . This condi-
tion may be recalled as that for critical damping, so that ω d = 0 and
α = ω 0 . Lower values of R and lower values of Q 0 cause the zeros to sep-
arate and move in opposite directions on the negative σ axis, but these low
values of Q 0 are not really typical of resonant circuits and we need not track
them any further.
Later, we will use the criterion Q 0 ≥ 5 to describe a high-Q circuit.
When Q 0 = 5, the zeros are located at s = −0.1ω 0 ± j0.995ω 0 , and thus
ω 0 and ω d differ by only one-half of 1 percent.
16.2 BANDWIDTH AND HIGH-Q CIRCUITS
•
We continue our discussion of parallel resonance by defining half-power
frequencies and bandwidth, and then we will make good use of these new
concepts in obtaining approximate response data for high-Q circuits. The
“width” of a resonance response curve, such as the one shown in Fig. 16.3,
may now be defined more carefully and related to Q 0 . Let us first define the
two half-power frequencies ω 1 and ω 2 as those frequencies at which the
magnitude of the input admittance of a parallel
√ resonant circuit is greater
than the magnitude at resonance by a factor of 2. Since the response curve

Y(s), located at s = −α ± jω d , provide a

These names arise from the fact that a voltage which is
1/ 2 times the resonant voltage is equivalent to a
squared voltage which is one-half the squared voltage
at resonance. Thus, at the half-power frequencies, the
resistor absorbs one-half the power that it does at
resonance.
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
of Fig. 16.3 displays the voltage produced across the parallel circuit by a
sinusoidal current source as a function of frequency, the half-power
√ fre-
quencies also locate those points at which the voltage response is 1/ 2, or
0.707, times its maximum value. A similar relationship holds for the imped-
ance magnitude. We will designate ω 1 as the lower half-power frequency
and ω 2 as the upper half-power frequency.
Bandwidth
The (half-power) bandwidth of a resonant circuit is defined as the differ-
ence of these two half-power frequencies.
B ≡ ω 2 − ω 1
[13]
We tend to think of bandwidth as the “width” of the response curve, even
though the curve actually extends from ω = 0 to ω = ∞. More exactly, the
half-power bandwidth is measured by that portion of the response curve
which is equal to or greater than 70.7 percent of the maximum value, as
illustrated in Fig. 16.5.

Approximations for High-Q Circuits
Many resonant circuits are deliberately designed to have a large Q 0 in order
to take advantage of the narrow bandwidth and high frequency selectivity
associated with such circuits. When Q 0 is larger than about 5, it is possible
to make some useful approximations in the expressions for the upper and
lower half-power frequencies and in the general expressions for the re-
sponse in the neighborhood of resonance. Let us arbitrarily refer to a “high-
Q circuit” as one for which Q 0 is equal to or greater than 5. The pole-zero
configuration of Y(s) for a parallel RLC circuit having a Q 0 of about 5 is

In a high-Q circuit, therefore, each half-power frequency is located ap-
proximately one-half bandwidth from the resonant frequency; this is indi-
cated in Fig. 16.6.
The approximate relationships for ω 1 and ω 2 in Eq. [17] may be added
to show that ω 0 is approximately equal to the arithmetic mean of ω 1 and ω 2
in high-Q circuits:
ω 0 ≈ 12 (ω 1 + ω 2 )

Now let us visualize a test point slightly above jω 0 on the jω axis. In order
to determine the admittance offered by the parallel RLC network at this fre-

test point. If the test point is close to jω 0 , then the vector from the pole is
approximately jω 0 and that from the lower zero is nearly j2ω 0 . The admit-

We seek the lower and upper half-power frequencies of the voltage
response as well as Y(ω 0 ). Since we are asked to “estimate” and
“approximate,” the implication is that this is a high-Q circuit, an
assumption we should verify.
᭤ Collect the known information.
Given R, L, and C, we are able to compute ω 0 and Q 0 . If Q 0 ≥ 5, we
may invoke approximate expressions for half-power frequencies and
admittance near resonance, but regardless could compute these quan-
tities exactly if required.

To use approximate expressions, we must first determine Q 0 , the
quality factor at resonance, as well as the bandwidth. √
The resonant frequency ω 0 is given by Eq. [2] as 1/ LC =
8 krad/s. Thus, Q 0 = ω 0 RC = 5, and the bandwidth is ω 0 /Q 0 =
1.6 krad/s. The value of Q 0 for this circuit is sufficient to employ
“high-Q” approximations.

to avoid confusing them with the parallel elements when the circuits are

Our discussion of parallel resonance occupied two sections of consider-
able length. We could now give the series RLC circuit the same kind of
treatment, but it is much cleverer to avoid such needless repetition and use
the concept of duality. For simplicity, let us concentrate on the conclusions
presented in the last paragraph of the preceding section on parallel reso-
nance. The important results are contained there, and the use of dual lan-
guage enables us to transcribe this paragraph to present the important

The voltage v s 100 cos ωt mV is applied to a series resonant
circuit composed of a 10 resistance, a 200 nF capacitance, and

relationships to estimate the equivalent impedance of the network
provided that we find that we are working with a high-Q circuit:

The series resonant circuit is characterized by a minimum impedance at
resonance, whereas the parallel resonant circuit produces a maximum reso-
nant impedance. The latter circuit provides inductor currents and capacitor
currents at resonance which have amplitudes Q 0 times as great as the source
current; the series resonant circuit provides inductor voltages and capacitor
voltages which are greater than the source voltage by the factor Q 0s . The
series circuit thus provides voltage amplification at resonance.

as the exact and approximate expressions we have developed, appears in

The parallel and series RLC circuits of the previous two sections represent
idealized resonant circuits. The degree of accuracy with which the idealized
model fits an actual circuit depends on the operating frequency range, the Q
of the circuit, the materials present in the physical elements, the element
sizes, and many other factors. We are not studying the techniques for deter-
mining the best model of a given physical circuit, for this requires some
knowledge of electromagnetic field theory and the properties of materials;
we are, however, concerned with the problem of reducing a more compli-
cated model to one of the two simpler models with which we are more
familiar.
The network shown in Fig. 16.9a is a reasonably accurate model for the
parallel combination of a physical inductor, capacitor, and resistor. The
resistor labeled R 1 is a hypothetical resistor that is included to account for
the ohmic, core, and radiation losses of the physical coil. The losses in the
dielectric within the physical capacitor, as well as the resistance of the phys-
ical resistor in the given RLC circuit, are accounted for by the resistor la-
beled R 2 . In this model, there is no way to combine elements and produce a
simpler model which is equivalent to the original model for all frequencies.
We will show, however, that a simpler equivalent may be constructed which
is valid over a frequency band that is usually large enough to include all fre-
quencies of interest. The equivalent will take the form of the network shown
in Fig. 16.9b.
Before we learn how to develop such an equivalent circuit, let us first
consider the given √ circuit, Fig. 16.9a. The resonant radian frequency for this
network is not 1/ LC , although if R 1 is sufficiently small it may be very
close to this value. The definition of resonance is unchanged, and we may
determine the resonant frequency by setting the imaginary part of the input
admittance equal to zero:
Im{Y( jω)} = Im

We note that ω 0 is less than 1/ LC , but sufficiently small values √
tio R 1 /L may result in a negligible difference between ω 0 and 1/ LC .
The maximum magnitude of the input impedance also deserves
√
consideration. It is not R 2 , and it does not occur at ω 0 (or at ω = 1/ LC ).
The proof of these statements will not be shown, because the expressions
soon become algebraically cumbersome; the theory, however, is straightfor-
ward. Let us be content with a numerical example.

Using the values R 1 2 , L 1 H, C 125 mF, and R 2 3 for
Fig. 16.9a, determine the resonant frequency and the impedance at

As can be seen in Fig. 16.10, however, the frequency at which the
maximum impedance magnitude occurs, indicated by ω m , can be deter-
mined to be ω m = 3.26 rad/s, and the maximum impedance magnitude is
Z( j3.26) = 1.980/−21.4 ◦
The impedance magnitude at resonance and the maximum magnitude
differ by about 16 percent. Although it is true that such an error may be
neglected occasionally in practice, it is too large to neglect on an exam.
(The later work in this section will show that the Q of the inductor-
resistor combination at 2 rad/s is unity; this low value accounts for the
16 percent discrepancy.)

Equivalent Series and Parallel Combinations
In order to transform the given circuit of Fig. 16.9a into an equivalent of the
form shown in Fig. 16.9b, we must discuss the Q of a simple series or par-
allel combination of a resistor and a reactor (inductor or capacitor). We first
consider the series circuit shown in Fig. 16.11a. The Q of this network is
again defined as 2π times the ratio of the maximum stored energy to the en-
ergy lost each period, but the Q may be evaluated at any frequency we
choose. In other words, Q is a function of ω. It is true that we will choose to
evaluate it at a frequency which is, or apparently is, the resonant frequency
of some network of which the series arm is a part. This frequency, however,
is not known until a more complete circuit is available. The reader is
encouraged to show that the Q of this series arm is |X s |/R s , whereas the Q
of the parallel network of Fig. 16.11b is R p /|X p |.
Let us now carry out the details necessary to find values for R p and X p so
that the parallel network of Fig. 16.11b is equivalent to the series network of
Fig. 16.11a at some single specific frequency. We equate Y s and Y p ,
Y s =

and obtain
R p = R s 2 + X s 2
R s
X p = R s 2 + X s 2

Dividing these two expressions, we find
R p
X s
=
X p
R s
It follows that the Q’s of the series and parallel networks must be equal:
Q p = Q s = Q
The transformation equations may therefore be simplified:

Also R s and X s may be found if R p and X p are the given values; the trans-
formation in either direction may be performed.

tionships

Find the parallel equivalent of the series combination of a 100 mH

Since the Q is sufficiently high (20 is much greater than 5), we use
Eqs. [24] and [25] to obtain
R p ≈ Q 2 R s = 2000
and
L p ≈ L s = 100 mH
Our assertion here is that a 100 mH inductor in series with a 5 resistor
provides essentially the same input impedance as does a 100 mH induc-
tor in parallel with a 2000 resistor at the frequency 1000 rad/s.
To check the accuracy of the equivalence, let us evaluate the input
impedance for each network at 1000 rad/s. We find
Z s ( j1000) = 5 + j100 = 100.1/87.1 ◦
2000( j100)
Z p ( j1000) =

tion frequency is pretty impressive. The accuracy at 900 rad/s is also
reasonably good, because

An “ideal” meter is an instrument that measures a
particular quantity of interest without disturbing the
circuit being tested. Although this is impossible, modern
instruments can come very close to being ideal in this
respect.
.
As a further example of the replacement of a more complicated resonant
circuit by an equivalent series or parallel RLC circuit, let us consider a prob-
lem in electronic instrumentation. The simple series RLC network in
Fig. 16.13a is excited by a sinusoidal voltage source at the network’s reso-
nant frequency. The effective (rms) value of the source voltage is 0.5 V, and
we wish to measure the effective value of the voltage across the capacitor
with an electronic voltmeter (VM) having an internal resistance of
100,000 . That is, an equivalent representation of the voltmeter is an ideal
voltmeter in parallel with a 100 k resistor.641

(b) The effect of the voltmeter is included in the circuit; it reads V c . (c) A series resonant circuit is obtained when the parallel RC network
in part (b) is replaced by the series RC network which is equivalent at 10 5 rad/s.
Before the voltmeter is connected, we compute that the resonant fre-
quency is 10 5 rad/s, Q 0 = 50, the current is 25 mA, and the rms capacitor
voltage is 25 V. (As indicated at the end of Sec. 16.3, this voltage is Q 0
times the applied voltage.) Thus, if the voltmeter were ideal, it would read
25 V when connected across the capacitor.
However, when the actual voltmeter is connected, the circuit shown in
Fig. 16.13b results. In order to obtain a series RLC circuit, it is now neces-
sary to replace the parallel RC network with a series RC network. Let us
assume that the Q of this RC network is sufficiently high that the equivalent
series capacitor will be the same as the given parallel capacitor. We do this
in order to approximate the resonant frequency of the final series RLC
circuit. Thus, if the series RLC circuit also contains a 0.01 μF capacitor, the
resonant frequency remains 10 5 rad/s. We need to know this estimated res-
onant frequency in order to calculate the Q of the parallel RC network; it is
Q =
R p
= ωR p C p = 10 5 (10 5 )(10 −8 ) = 100

Since this value is greater than 5, our vicious circle of assumptions is justi-
fied, and the equivalent series RC network consists of the capacitor C s =
0.01 μF and the resistor
R s ≈
R p
= 10
Q 2
Hence, the equivalent circuit of Fig. 16.13c is obtained. The resonant Q of
this circuit is now only 33.3, and thus the voltage across the capacitor in the
circuit of Fig. 16.13c is 16 23 V. But we need to find |V C |, the voltage across
the series RC combination; we obtain
|V C | =
0.5
|10 − j1000| = 16.67 V

100 k⍀642
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
The capacitor voltage and |V C | are essentially equal, since the voltage
across the 10 resistor is quite small.
The final conclusion must be that an apparently good voltmeter may still
produce a severe effect on the response of a high-Q resonant circuit. A
similar effect may occur when a nonideal ammeter is inserted in the circuit.
We wrap up this section with a technical fable.

nce upon a time there was a student named Sean, who had a professor
identified simply as Dr. Abel.
In the laboratory one afternoon, Dr. Abel gave Sean three practical cir-
cuit devices: a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, having nominal element
values of 20 , 20 mH, and 1 μF. The student was asked to connect a
variable-frequency voltage source to the series combination of these three
elements, to measure the resultant voltage across the resistor as a function
of frequency, and then to calculate numerical values for the resonant fre-
quency, the Q at resonance, and the half-power bandwidth. The student was
also asked to predict the results of the experiment before making the
measurements.

with the predicted values, and then felt a strong urge to transfer to the busi-
ness school. The results were
f 0 = 1000 Hz
Q 0 = 0.625
B = 1600 Hz
Sean knew that discrepancies of this magnitude could not be characterized
as being “within engineering accuracy” or “due to meter errors.” Sadly, the
results were handed to the professor.
Remembering many past errors in judgment, some of which were even
(possibly) self-made, Dr. Abel smiled kindly and called Sean’s attention to
the Q-meter (or impedance bridge) which is present in most well-equipped
laboratories, and suggested that it might be used to find out what these prac-
tical circuit elements really looked like at some convenient frequency near
resonance, 1000 Hz, for example.
Upon doing so, Sean discovered that the resistor had a measured value
of 18 and the inductor was 21.4 mH with a Q of 1.2, while the capacitor
had a capacitance of 1.41 μF and a dissipation factor (the reciprocal of Q)
equal to 0.123.
So, with the hope that springs eternal within the heart of every engi-
neering undergraduate, Sean reasoned that a better model for the practical
inductor would be 21.4 mH in series with ωL/Q = 112 , while a moreSECTION 16.4 OTHER RESONANT FORMS

appropriate model for the capacitor would be 1.41 μF in series with

B = 916/0.856 = 1070 Hz
Since these results were much closer to the measured values, Sean was
much happier. Dr. Abel, however, being a stickler for detail, pondered the
differences in the predicted and measured values for both Q 0 and the band-
width. “Have you,” Dr. Abel asked, “given any consideration to the output
impedance of the voltage source?” “Not yet,” said Sean, trotting back to the
laboratory bench.
It turned out that the output impedance in question was 50 and so
Sean added this value to the circuit diagram, as shown in Fig. 16.16. Using
the new equivalent resistance value of 193.9 , improved values for Q 0 and
B were then obtained:

SCALING
Some of the examples and problems that we have been solving have in-
volved circuits containing passive element values ranging around a few
ohms, a few henrys, and a few farads. The applied frequencies were a few
radians per second. These particular numerical values were used not be-
cause they are those commonly met in practice, but because arithmetic ma-
nipulations are so much easier than they would be if it were necessary to
carry along various powers of 10 throughout the calculations. The scaling
procedures that will be discussed in this section enable us to analyze net-
works composed of practical-sized elements by scaling the element values
to permit more convenient numerical calculations. We will consider both
magnitude scaling and frequency scaling.
Let us select the parallel resonant circuit shown in Fig. 16.17a as our
example. The impractical element values lead to the unlikely response curve
drawn as Fig. 16.17b; the maximum impedance is 2.5 , the resonant fre-
quency is 1 rad/s, Q 0 is 5, and the bandwidth is 0.2 rad/s. These numerical val-
ues are much more characteristic of the electrical analog of some mechanical
system than they are of any basically electrical device. We have convenient
numbers with which to calculate, but an impractical circuit to construct.

Recall that “ordinate” refers to the vertical axis and
“abscissa” refers to the horizontal axis.
Our goal is to scale this network in such a way as to provide an impedance
maximum of 5000 at a resonant frequency of 5 × 10 6 rad/s, or 796 kHz. In
other words, we may use the same response curve shown in Fig. 16.17b if645
SECTION 16.5 SCALING
every number on the ordinate scale is increased by a factor of 2000 and every
number on the abscissa scale is increased by a factor of 5 × 10 6 . We will treat
this as two problems: (1) scaling in magnitude by a factor of 2000 and
(2) scaling in frequency by a factor of 5 × 10 6 .
Magnitude scaling is defined as the process by which the impedance of
a two-terminal network is increased by a factor of K m , the frequency re-
maining constant. The factor K m is real and positive; it may be greater or
smaller than unity. We will understand that the shorter statement ‘‘the net-
work is scaled in magnitude by a factor of 2” indicates that the impedance
of the new network is to be twice that of the old network at any frequency.
Let us now determine how we must scale each type of passive element. To
increase the input impedance of a network by a factor of K m , it is sufficient
to increase the impedance of each element in the network by this same
factor. Thus, a resistance R must be replaced by a resistance K m R. Each
inductance must also exhibit an impedance which is K m times as great at
any frequency. In order to increase an impedance s L by a factor of K m when
s remains constant, the inductance L must be replaced by an inductance
K m L. In a similar manner, each capacitance C must be replaced by a capac-
itance C/K m . In summary, these changes will produce a network which is
scaled in magnitude by a factor of K m :

magnitude scaling
When each element in the network of Fig. 16.17a is scaled in magnitude by
a factor of 2000, the network shown in Fig. 16.18a results. The response
curve shown in Fig. 16.18b indicates that no change in the previously
drawn response curve need be made other than a change in the scale of the
ordinate.
Let us now take this new network and scale it in frequency. We define
frequency scaling as the process by which the frequency at which any im-
pedance occurs is increased by a factor of K f . Again, we will make use of
the shorter expression “the network is scaled in frequency by a factor of 2”
to indicate that the same impedance is now obtained at a frequency twice as
great. Frequency scaling is accomplished by scaling each passive element
in frequency. It is apparent that no resistor is affected. The impedance of any
inductor is sL, and if this same impedance is to be obtained at a frequency K f
times as great, then the inductance L must be replaced by an inductance of
L/K f . Similarly, a capacitance C is to be replaced by a capacitance C/K f .
Thus, if a network is to be scaled in frequency by a factor of K f , then the
changes necessary in each passive element are

When each element of the magnitude-scaled network of Fig. 16.18a is
scaled in frequency by a factor of 5 × 10 6 , the network of Fig. 16.19a
is obtained. The corresponding response curve is shown in Fig. 16.19b.
The circuit elements in this last network have values which are easily
achieved in physical circuits; the network can actually be built and tested. It
follows that, if the original network of Fig. 16.17a were actually an analog
of some mechanical resonant system, we could have scaled this analog in
both magnitude and frequency in order to achieve a network which we
might construct in the laboratory; tests that are expensive or inconvenient to
run on the mechanical system could then be made on the scaled electrical
system, and the results should then be “unscaled” and converted into me-
chanical units to complete the analysis.
An impedance that is given as a function of s may also be scaled in mag-
nitude or frequency, and this may be done without any knowledge of the
specific elements of which the two-terminal network is composed. In order
to scale Z(s) in magnitude, the definition of magnitude scaling shows that it
is necessary only to multiply Z(s) by K m in order to obtain the magnitude-
scaled impedance. Hence, the impedance Z (s) of the magnitude-scaled
network is
Z (s) = K m Z(s)
If Z (s) is now to be scaled in frequency by a factor of 5 × 10 6 , then Z (s)
and Z (s) are to provide identical values of impedance if Z (s) is evaluated
at a frequency K f times that at which Z (s) is evaluated, or
Z (s) = Z

K f
Although scaling is a process normally applied to passive elements, de-
pendent sources may also be scaled in magnitude and frequency. We assume
that the output of any source is given as k x v x or k y i y , where k x has the
dimensions of an admittance for a dependent current source and is dimen-
sionless for a dependent voltage source, while k y has the dimensions of
ohms for a dependent voltage source and is dimensionless for a dependent647
SECTION 16.5 SCALING
current source. If the network containing the dependent source is scaled in
magnitude by K m , then it is necessary only to treat k x or k y as if it were the
type of element consistent with its dimensions. That is, if k x (or k y ) is di-
mensionless, it is left unchanged; if it is an admittance, it is divided by K m ;
and if it is an impedance, it is multiplied by K m . Frequency scaling does not
affect the dependent sources.

this is a voltage-controlled current source, the multiplying constant 0.2
has units of A/V, or S. Since the factor has units of admittance, we
divide by K m , so that the new term is 0.01V 1 . The resulting (scaled)
network is shown in Fig. 16.20b.
To find the impedance of the new network, we need to apply a 1 A
test source at the input terminals. We may work with either circuit;
however, let’s proceed by first finding the impedance of the unscaled
network in Fig. 16.20a, and then scaling the result.

16.6 BODE DIAGRAMS
•
In this section we will discover a quick method of obtaining an approximate
picture of the amplitude and phase variation of a given transfer function as
functions of ω. Accurate curves may, of course, be plotted after calculating
values with a programmable calculator or a computer; curves may also be
produced directly on the computer. Our object here, however, is to obtain a
better picture of the response than we could visualize from a pole-zero plot,
but yet not mount an all-out computational offensive.649
SECTION 16.6 BODE DIAGRAMS
The Decibel (dB) Scale
The approximate response curve we construct is called an asymptotic plot,
or a Bode plot, or a Bode diagram, after its developer, Hendrik W. Bode,
who was an electrical engineer and mathematician with the Bell Telephone
Laboratories. Both the magnitude and phase curves are shown using a
logarithmic frequency scale for the abscissa, and the magnitude itself is also
shown in logarithmic units called decibels (dB). We define the value of
|H( jω)| in dB as follows:
H dB = 20 log |H( jω)|
where the common logarithm (base 10) is used. (A multiplier of 10 instead
of 20 is used for power transfer functions, but we will not need it here.) The
inverse operation is
|H( jω)| = 10 H dB /20
Before we actually begin a detailed discussion of the technique for
drawing Bode diagrams, it will help to gain some feeling for the size of the
decibel unit, to learn a few of its important values, and to recall some of
the properties of the logarithm. Since log 1 = 0, log 2 = 0.30103, and
log 10 = 1, we note the correspondences:
|H( jω)| = 1 ⇔ H dB = 0
|H( jω)| = 2 ⇔ H dB ≈ 6 dB
|H( jω)| = 10 ⇔ H dB = 20 dB
An increase of |H( jω)| by a factor of 10 corresponds to an increase in H dB
by 20 dB. Moreover, log 10 n = n, and thus 10 n ⇔ 20n dB, so that 1000
corresponds to 60 dB, while 0.01 is represented as −40 dB. Using only the

nitude may be written in terms of dB at that point.

(2) Note that we are being slightly
√ dishonest here by using 20 log 2 = 6 dB rather than 6.02 dB. It is
customary, however, to represent 2 as 3 dB; since the dB scale is inherently logarithmic, the small
inaccuracy is seldom significant.
The decibel is named in honor of Alexander
Graham Bell.650

A decade refers to a range of frequencies defined by a

At ω = a, H dB = 0; at ω = 10a, H dB = 20 dB; and at ω = 100a, H dB = 40
dB. Thus, the value of H dB increases 20 dB for every 10-fold increase in fre-
quency. The asymptote therefore has a slope of 20 dB/decade. Since H dB
increases by 6 dB when ω doubles, an alternate value for the slope is 6 dB/
octave. The high-frequency asymptote is also shown in Fig. 16.21, a solid651

intersect at ω = a, the frequency of the zero. This frequency is also desc-
ribed as the corner, break, 3 dB, or half-power frequency.
Smoothing Bode Plots
Let us see how much error is embodied in our asymptotic response curve.
At the corner frequency (ω = a),
H dB = 20 log 1 +
Note that we continue to abide by the convention
of taking 2 as corresponding to 3 dB.

as compared with an asymptotic value of 0 dB. At ω = 0.5a, we have
√
H dB = 20 log 1.25 ≈ 1 dB
Thus, the exact response is represented by a smooth curve that lies 3 dB
above the asymptotic response at ω = a, and 1 dB above it at ω = 0.5a
(and also at ω = 2a). This information can always be used to smooth out the
corner if a more exact result is desired.
Multiple Terms
Most transfer functions will consist of more than a simple zero (or simple
pole). This, however, is easily handled by the Bode method, since we are in
fact working with logarithms. For example, consider a function
H(s) = K 1 +
s
s 1

where K = constant, and −s 1 and −s 2 represent the two zeros of our
function H(s). For this function H dB may be written as

which is simply the sum of a constant (frequency-independent) term 20 log K
and two simple zero terms of the form previously considered. In other words,
we may construct a sketch of H dB by simply graphically adding the plots of
the separate terms. We explore this in the following example.652

It is worth pausing briefly here to consider what the phase plot is telling

corner frequency, the phase of the transfer function varies somewhat
rapidly. The actual phase angle imparted to the response can therefore be
selected through the design of the circuit (which determines a).

Additional Considerations in Creating Bode Plots
We next consider a simple pole,
H(s) =
1
1 + s/a
[27]
Since this is the reciprocal of a zero, the logarithmic operation leads to a Bode
plot which is the negative of that obtained previously. The amplitude is 0 dB
up to ω = a, and then the slope is −20 dB/decade for ω > a. The angle plot
is 0 ◦ for ω < 0.1a, −90 ◦ for ω > 10a, and −45 ◦ at ω = a, and it has a slope
of −45 ◦ /decade when 0.1a < ω < 10a. The reader is encouraged to generate
the Bode plot for this function by working directly with Eq. [27].

CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Another term that can appear in H(s) is a factor of s in the numerator or
denominator. If H(s) = s, then
H dB = 20 log |ω|
Thus, we have an infinite straight line passing through 0 dB at ω = 1 and
having a slope everywhere of 20 dB/decade. This is shown in Fig. 16.25a.
If the s factor occurs in the denominator, a straight line is obtained having a
slope of −20 dB/decade and passing through 0 dB at ω = 1, as shown in
Fig. 16.25b.

Before we construct the phase plot for the amplifier of Fig. 16.26, let us
take a few moments to investigate several of the details of the magnitude
plot.
First, it is wise not to rely too heavily on graphical addition of the indi-
vidual magnitude plots. Instead, the exact value of the combined magnitude
plot may be found easily at selected points by considering the asymptotic
655656
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
value of each factor of H(s) at the point in question. For example, in the flat
region of Fig. 16.27a between ω = 10 and ω = 20,000, we are below the
corner at ω = 20,000, and so we represent (1 + s/20,000) by 1; but we are
above ω = 10, so (1 + s/10) is represented as ω/10. Hence,
−2ω
(ω/10)(1)
= 20 log 20 = 26 dB
H dB = 20 log
(10 < ω < 20,000)
We might also wish to know the frequency at which the asymptotic re-
sponse crosses the abscissa at the high end. The two factors are expressed
here as ω/10 and ω/20,000; thus
H dB = 20 log
−2ω
400,000
= 20 log
(ω/10)(ω/20,000)
ω
Since H dB = 0 at the abscissa crossing, 400,000/ω = 1, and therefore
ω = 400,000 rad/s.
Many times we do not need an accurate Bode plot drawn on printed
semilog paper. Instead we construct a rough logarithmic frequency axis
on simple lined paper. After selecting the interval for a decade—say, a dis-
tance L extending from ω = ω 1 to ω = 10ω 1 (where ω 1 is usually an
integral power of 10)—we let x locate the distance that ω lies to the right
of ω 1 , so that x/L = log(ω/ω 1 ). Of particular help is the knowledge that
x = 0.3L when ω = 2ω 1 , x = 0.6L at ω = 4ω 1 , and x = 0.7L at ω = 5ω 1 .
EXAMPLE 16.9
Draw the phase plot for the transfer function given by Eq. [28],
H(s) −2s/[(1 + s/10)(1 + s/20,000)].
We begin by inspecting H( jω):
H( jω) =
− j2ω
(1 + jω/10)(1 + jω/20,000)
[29]
The angle of the numerator is a constant, −90 ◦ .
The remaining factors are represented as the sum of the angles con-
tributed by break points at ω = 10 and ω = 20,000. These three terms
appear as broken-line asymptotic curves in Fig. 16.28, and their sum is
shown as the solid curve. An equivalent representation is obtained if the
curve is shifted upward by 360 ◦ .
Exact values can also be obtained for the asymptotic phase response.
For example, at ω = 10 4 rad/s, the angle in Fig. 16.28 is obtained from
the numerator and denominator terms in Eq. [29]. The numerator angle
is −90 ◦ . The angle for the pole at ω = 10 is −90 ◦ , since ω is greater than
10 times the corner frequency. Between 0.1 and 10 times the corner fre-
quency, we recall that the slope is −45 ◦ per decade for a simple pole.
For the break point at 20,000 rad/s, we therefore calculate the angle,
−45 ◦ log(ω/0.1a) = −45 ◦ log[10,000/(0.1 × 20,000)] = −31.5 ◦ .SECTION 16.6 BODE DIAGRAMS

Higher-Order Terms
The zeros and poles that we have been considering are all first-order terms,
such as s ±1 , (1 + 0.2s) ±1 , and so forth. We may extend our analysis
to higher-order poles and zeros very easily, however. A term s ±n yields
a magnitude response that passes through ω = 1 with a slope of
±20n dB/decade; the phase response is a constant angle of ±90n ◦ . Also, a
multiple zero, (1 + s/a) n , must represent the sum of n of the magnitude-
response curves, or n of the phase-response curves of the simple zero. We
therefore obtain an asymptotic magnitude plot that is 0 dB for ω < a and
has a slope of 20n dB/decade when ω > a; the error is −3n dB at ω = a,
and −n dB at ω = 0.5a and 2a. The phase plot is 0 ◦ for ω < 0.1a, 90n ◦ for
ω > 10a , 45n ◦ at ω = a , and a straight line with a slope of 45n ◦ /
decade for 0.1a < ω < 10a, and it has errors as large as ±5.71n ◦ at two
frequencies.
The asymptotic magnitude and phase curves associated with a factor
such as (1 + s/20) −3 may be drawn quickly, but the relatively large errors
associated with the higher powers should be kept in mind.

CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
Complex Conjugate Pairs
The last type of factor we should consider represents a conjugate complex
pair of poles or zeros. We adopt the following as the standard form for a pair
of zeros:
H(s) = 1 + 2ζ
s
ω 0
+
s
ω 0
2
The quantity ζ is the damping factor introduced in Sec. 16.1, and we will
see shortly that ω 0 is the corner frequency of the asymptotic response.
If ζ = 1, we see that H(s) = 1 + 2(s/ω 0 ) + (s/ω 0 ) 2 = (1 + s/ω 0 ) 2 , a
second-order zero such as we have just considered. If ζ > 1, then H(s) may
be factored to show two simple zeros. Thus, if ζ = 1.25, then H(s) =
1 + 2.5(s/ω 0 ) + (s/ω 0 ) 2 = (1 + s/2ω 0 )(1 + s/0.5ω 0 ), and we again have
a familiar situation.
A new case arises when 0 ≤ ζ ≤ 1. There is no need to find values for
the conjugate complex pair of roots. Instead, we determine the low- and
high-frequency asymptotic values for both the magnitude and phase re-
sponse, and then apply a correction that depends on the value of ζ .
For the magnitude response, we have

This is the high-frequency asymptote, and the two asymptotes intersect at
0 dB, ω = ω 0 . The solid curve in Fig. 16.29 shows this asymptotic repre-
sentation of the magnitude response. However, a correction must be applied

If ζ = 1, a limiting case, the correction is +6 dB; for ζ = 0.5, no correction
is required; and if ζ = 0.1, the correction is −14 dB. Knowing this one cor-
rection value is often sufficient to draw a satisfactory asymptotic magnitude
response. Figure 16.29 shows more accurate curves for ζ = 1, 0.5, 0.25,
and 0.1, as calculated from Eq. [30]. For example, if ζ = 0.25, then the
exact value of H dB at ω = 0.5ω 0 is
H dB = 20 log |1 + j0.25 − 0.25| = 20 log 0.75 2 + 0.25 2 = −2.0 dB
The negative peaks do not show a minimum value exactly at ω = ω 0 , as we
can see by the curve for ζ = 0.5. The valley is always found at a slightly
lower frequency.
If ζ = 0, then H( jω 0 ) = 0 and H dB = −∞. Bode plots are not usually
drawn for this situation.
Our last task is to draw the asymptotic phase response for H( jω) = 1 +
j2ζ(ω/ω 0 ) − (ω/ω 0 ) 2 . Below ω = 0.1ω 0 , we let ang H( jω) = 0 ◦ ; above
ω = 10ω 0 , we have ang H( jω) = ang [−(ω/ω 0 ) 2 ] = 180 ◦ . At the corner
frequency, ang H( jω 0 ) = ang ( j2ζ ) = 90 ◦ . In the interval 0.1ω 0 <
ω < 10ω 0 , we begin with the straight line shown as a solid curve in
Fig. 16.30. It extends from (0.1ω 0 , 0 ◦ ), through (ω 0 , 90 ◦ ), and terminates at
(10ω 0 , 180 ◦ ); it has a slope of 90 ◦ /decade.

0.25, and 0.1; heavy dots identify accurate values at ω = 0.5ω 0 and ω = 2ω 0 .
If the quadratic factor appears in the denominator, both the magnitude
and phase curves are the negatives of those just discussed. We conclude
with an example that contains both linear and quadratic factors.
EXAMPLE 16.10
Construct the Bode plot for the transfer function H(s)
100,000s/[(s + 1)(10,000 + 20s + s 2 )].
Let’s consider the quadratic factor first and arrange it in a form such
that we can see the value of ζ . We begin by dividing the second-order
factor by its constant term, 10,000:
10s
H(s) =
(1 + s)(1 + 0.002s + 0.0001s 2 )
√
An inspection of the s 2 term next shows that ω 0 = 1/0.0001 = 100.
Then the linear term of the quadratic is written to display the factor 2,
the factor (s/ω 0 ), and finally the factor ζ :
10s
H(s) =
(1 + s)[1 + (2)(0.1)(s/100) + (s/100) 2 ]
We see that ζ = 0.1.
The asymptotes of the magnitude-response curve are sketched in
lightly in Fig. 16.31: 20 dB for the factor of 10, an infinite straight line
through ω = 1 with a +20 dB/decade slope for the s factor, a corner
at ω = 1 for the simple pole, and a corner at ω = 100 with a slope of
−40 dB/decade for the second-order term in the denominator. Adding
these four curves and supplying a correction of +14 dB for the qua-
dratic factor lead to the heavy curve of Fig. 16.31.

COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
The technique of generating Bode plots is a valuable one. There are
many situations in which an approximate diagram is needed quickly
(such as on exams, or when evaluating a particular circuit topology for a
specific application), and simply knowing the general shape of the re-
sponse is adequate. Further, Bode plots can be invaluable when design-
ing filters in terms of enabling us to select factors and coefficient values.
In situations where exact response curves are required (such as when
verifying a final circuit design), there are several computer-assisted op-
tions available to the engineer. The first technique we will consider here
is the use of MATLAB to generate a frequency response curve. In order
to accomplish this, the circuit must first be analyzed to obtain the cor-
rect transfer function. However, it is not necessary to factor or simplify
the expression.
Consider the circuit in Fig. 16.26. We previously determined that the
transfer function for this circuit can be expressed as
H(s) =
−2s
(1 + s/10)(1 + s/20,000)
(Continued on next page)662
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
We seek a detailed graph of this function over the frequency range of
100 mrad/s to 1 Mrad/s. Since the final graph will be plotted on a
logarithmic scale, there is no need to uniformly space our discrete
frequencies. Instead, we use the MATLAB function logspace() to gen-
erate a frequency vector, where the first two arguments represent the
power of 10 for starting and ending frequencies, respectively (−1 and
6 in the present example), and the third argument is the total number of
points desired. Thus, our MATLAB script is
EDU» w = logspace(−1,6,100);
EDU» denom = (1+j*w/10) .* (1+j*w/20000);
EDU» H = −2*j*w ./ denom;
EDU» Hdb = 20*log10(abs(H));
EDU» semilogx(w,Hdb)
EDU» xlabel(’frequency (rad/s)’)
EDU» ylabel (’|H(jw)| (dB)’)
which yields the graph depicted in Fig. 16.33.
■ FIGURE 16.33 Plot of H dB generated using MATLAB.
A few comments about the MATLAB code are warranted. First, note
that we have substituted s = jω in our expression for H(s). Also,
MATLAB treats the variable w as a vector, or one-dimensional matrix.
As such, this variable can cause difficulties in the denominator of an
expression as MATLAB will attempt to apply matrix algebra rules to any
expression. Thus, the denominator of H( jω) is computed in a separate
line, and the operator “.*” is required instead of “*” to multiply the two
terms. This new operator is equivalent to the following MATLAB code:
EDU» for k = 1:100
denom = (1 + j*w(k)/10) * (1 + j*w(k)/20000);
end
In a similar fashion, the new operator “./” is used in the subsequent
line of code. The results are desired in dB, so the function log10() isSECTION 16.6 BODE DIAGRAMS
invoked; log() represents the natural logarithm in MATLAB. Finally,
the new plot command semilogx() is used to generate a graph with the
x axis having a logarithmic scale. The reader is encouraged at this point
to return to previous examples, and use these techniques to generate
exact curves for comparison to the corresponding Bode plots.
PSpice is also commonly used to generate frequency response
curves, especially to evaluate a final design. Figure 16.34a depicts the
circuit of Fig. 16.26, where the voltage across the resistor R3 represents
the desired output voltage. The source component VAC has been

employed with a fixed voltage of 1 V for convenience. An ac sweep
simulation is required to determine the frequency response of our
circuit; Fig. 16.34b was generated using 10 points per decade (with
Decade selected under Logarithmic AC Sweep Type) from 10 mHz to
1 MHz. Note the simulation has been performed in Hz, not rad/s, so the
cursor tool is indicating a bandwidth of 3.137 kHz.
Again, the reader is encouraged to simulate example circuits and
compare the results to the Bode plots generated previously.
16.7 BASIC FILTER DESIGN
•
The design of filters is a very practical (and interesting) subject, worthy of a
separate textbook in its own right. In this section, we introduce some of the
basic concepts of filtering, and explore both passive and active filter circuits.
These circuits may be very simple, consisting of a single capacitor or induc-
tor whose addition to a given network leads to improved performance. They
may also be fairly sophisticated, consisting of many resistors, capacitors, in-
ductors, and op amps in order to obtain the precise response curve required

for a given application. Filters are used in modern electronics to obtain dc
voltages in power supplies, eliminate noise in communication channels,
separate radio and television channels from the multiplexed signal provided
by antennas, and boost the bass signal in a car stereo, to name just a few
applications.
The underlying concept of a filter is that it selects the frequencies that
may pass through a network. There are several varieties, depending on the
needs of a particular application. A low-pass filte , the response of which is
illustrated in Fig. 16.35a, passes frequencies below a cutoff frequency,
while significantly damping frequencies above that cutoff. A high-pass
filte , on the other hand, does just the opposite, as shown in Fig. 16.35b. The
chief figure of merit of a filter is the sharpness of the cutoff, or the steepness
of the curve in the vicinity of the corner frequency. In general, steeper
response curves require more complex circuits.
Combining a low-pass and a high-pass filter can lead to what is known as
a bandpass filte , as illustrated by the response curve shown in Fig. 16.35c.
In this type of filter, the region between the two corner frequencies is referred
to as the passband; the region outside the passband is referred to as the stop-
band. These terms may also be applied to the low- and high-pass filters, as
indicated in Fig. 16.35a and b. We can also create a bandstop filte , which
allows both high and low frequencies to pass but attenuates any signal with
a frequency between the two corner frequencies (Fig. 16.35d).
The notch filter is a specialized bandstop filter, designed with a narrow
response characteristic that blocks a single frequency component of a
signal. Multiband filters are also possible; these are filter circuits which
have multiple passbands and stopbands. The design of such filters is
straightforward, but beyond the range of this book.

A filter can be constructed by simply using a single capacitor and a single

ter circuit is

(a)
[32]
H(s) has a single corner frequency, which occurs at ω = 1/RC, and a zero
at s = ∞, leading to its “low-pass” filtering behavior. Low frequencies
(s → 0) result in |H(s)| near its maximum value (unity, or 0 dB), and high
frequencies (s → ∞) result in |H(s)| → 0. This behavior can be understood
qualitatively by considering the impedance of the capacitor: as the fre-
quency increases, the capacitor begins to act like a short-circuit to ac signals,
leading to a reduction in the output voltage. An example response curve for
such a filter with R = 500 and C = 2 nF is shown in Fig. 16.36b; the cor-
ner frequency of 159 kHz (1 Mrad/s) can be found by moving the cursor
to −3 dB. The sharpness of the response curve in the vicinity of the cutoff
frequency can be improved by moving to a circuit containing additional re-
active (i.e., capacitive and/or inductive) elements.
A high-pass filter can be constructed by simply swapping the locations
of the resistor and capacitor in Fig. 16.36a, as we see in the next example.

Fig. 16.37.

which has a zero at s = 0 and a pole at s = −1/RC, leading to “high-
pass” filter behavior (i.e., |H| → 0 as ω → ∞).
The corner frequency of the filter circuit is ω c = 1/RC, and we seek a
value of ω c = 2π f c = 2π(3000) = 18.85 krad/s. Again, we must select a
value for either R or C. In practice, our decision would most likely be
based on the values of resistors and capacitors at hand, but since no such
information has been provided here, we are free to make arbitrary choices.
We therefore choose the standard resistor value 4.7 k for R,
leading to a requirement of C = 11.29 nF.
The only remaining step is to verify our design with a PSpice simu-
lation; the predicted frequency response curve is shown in Fig. 16.38.

SECTION 16.7 BASIC FILTER DESIGN
Bandpass Filters
We have already seen several circuits earlier in this chapter which could
be classified as “bandpass” filters (e.g., Figs. 16.1 and 16.8). Consider the
simple circuit of Fig. 16.39, in which the output is taken across the resistor.

ωL
We know from our experience with Bode plots that Eq. [33] represents
three critical frequencies: one zero and two poles. In order to obtain a band-
pass filter response with a peak value of unity (0 dB), both pole frequencies
must be greater than 1 rad/s, the 0 dB crossover frequency of the zero term.
These two critical frequencies can be obtained by factoring
√ Eq. [33] or de-
termining the values of ω at which Eq. [34] is √ equal to 1/ 2. The center fre-
quency of this filter then occurs at ω = 1/ LC . Thus, applying a √ minor
amount of algebraic manipulation after setting Eq. [34] equal to 1/ 2, we
find that
1 − LCω c 2

Negative frequency is a nonphysical solution to our original equation, and
so only the positive radicand of Eq. [36] is applicable. However, we may
have been a little too hasty in taking the positive square root of both sides of
Eq. [35]. Considering the negative square root as well, which is equally
valid, we also obtain

simple algebra shows that B = R/L .668
CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
EXAMPLE 16.12
Design a bandpass filte characterized by a bandwidth of 1 MHz
and a high-frequency cutoff of 1.1 MHz.
We choose the circuit topology of Fig. 16.39, and begin by determining
the corner frequencies required. The bandwidth is given by f H − f L , so
f L = 1.1 × 10 6 − 1 × 10 6 = 100 kHz
and
ω L = 2π f L = 628.3 krad/s
The high-frequency cutoff (ω H ) is simply 6.912 Mrad/s.
In order to proceed to design a circuit with these characteristics, it is
necessary to obtain an expression for each frequency in terms of the
variables R, L, and C.
Setting Eq. [37] equal to 2π(1.1 × 10 6 ) allows us to solve for 1/LC ,
as we already know that B = 2π( f H − f L ) = 6.283 × 10 6 .

that there is no unique solution for this “design” problem—R, L, or C
can be selected as a starting point.

The type of circuit we have been considering is known as a passive
filte , as it is constructed of only passive components (i.e., no transistors, op
amps, or other “active” elements). Although passive filters are relatively
common, they are not well suited to all applications. The gain (defined as
the output voltage divided by the input voltage) of a passive filter can be dif-
ficult to set, and amplification is often desirable in filter circuits.
Active Filters
The use of an active element such as the op amp in filter design can overcome
many of the shortcomings of passive filters. As we saw in Chap. 6, op amp
circuits can easily be designed to provide gain. Op amp circuits can also
exhibit inductorlike behavior through the strategic location of capacitors.
The internal circuitry of an op amp contains very small capacitances
(typically on the order of 100 pF), and these limit the maximum frequency
at which the op amp will function properly. Thus, any op amp circuit will
behave as a low-pass filter, with a cutoff frequency for modern devices of
perhaps 20 MHz or more (depending on the circuit gain).
EXAMPLE 16.13
Design an active low-pass filte with a cutoff frequency of 10 kHz
and a voltage gain of 40 dB.
For frequencies much less than 10 kHz, we require an amplifier circuit
capable of providing a gain of 40 dB, or 100 V/V. This can be accom-
plished by simply using a noninverting amplifier (such as the one
shown in Fig. 16.41a) with

CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
To provide a high-frequency corner at 10 kHz, we require a low-pass
filter at the input to the op amp (as in Fig. 16.41b). To derive the transfer
function, we begin at the noninverting input,
V + = V i

The maximum value of the gain A V = V o /V i is 1 + R f /R 1 , so we set
this quantity equal to 100. Since neither resistor appears in the expres-
sion for the corner frequency (R 2 C) −1 , either may be selected first. We
thus choose R 1 = 1 k , so R f = 99 k .
Arbitrarily selecting C = 1 μF, we find that
R 2 =

At this point, our design is complete. Or is it? The simulated frequency
response of this circuit is shown in Fig. 16.42a.
It is readily apparent that our design does not in fact meet the
10 kHz cutoff specification. What did we do wrong? A careful check of
our algebra does not yield any errors, so an erroneous assumption must
have been made somewhere. The simulation was performed using a
μA741 op amp, as opposed to the ideal op amp assumed in the deriva-
tions. It turns out that this is the source of our discomfort—the same
circuit with an LF411 op amp substituted for the μA741 results in a
cutoff frequency of 10 kHz as desired; the corresponding simulation
result is shown in Fig. 16.42b.
Unfortunately, the μA741 op amp with a gain of 40 dB has a corner
frequency in the vicinity of 10 kHz, which cannot be neglected in this
instance. The LF411, however, does not reach its first corner frequency
until approximately 75 kHz, which is far enough away from 10 kHz
that it does not affect our design.

PRACTICAL
APPLICATION
Bass, Treble, and Midrange Adjustment
The ability to independently adjust the bass, treble, and
midrange settings on a sound system is commonly desir-
able, even in the case of inexpensive equipment. The au-
dio frequency range (at least for the human ear) is
commonly accepted to be 20 Hz to 20 kHz, with bass
corresponding to lower frequencies (< 500 Hz or so) and
treble corresponding to higher frequencies (> 5 kHz or
thereabouts).
Designing a simple graphic equalizer is a relatively
straightforward endeavor, although a system such as that
shown in Fig. 16.43 requires a bit more effort. In the
bass, midrange, treble type equalizer common on many
portable radios, the main signal (provided by the radio
receiver circuit, or perhaps a CD player) consists of a
wide spectrum of frequencies having a bandwidth of ap-
proximately 20 kHz.
■ FIGURE 16.43 An example of a graphic equalizer.

This signal must be sent to three different op amp cir-
cuits, each with a different filter at the input. The bass ad-
justment circuit will require a low-pass filter, the treble
adjustment circuit will require a high-pass filter, and the
midrange adjustment circuit requires a bandpass filter.
The output of each op amp circuit is then fed into a sum-
ming amplifier circuit; a block diagram of the complete
circuit is shown in Fig. 16.44.

Our basic building block is shown in Fig. 16.45. This
circuit consists of a noninverting op amp circuit charac-
terized by a voltage gain of 1 + R f /R 1 , and a simple
low-pass filter composed of a resistor R 2 and a capacitor
C. The feedback resistor R f is a variable resistor (some-
times referred to as a potentiometer), and allows the gain
to be varied through the rotation of a knob; the layperson

would call this resistor the volume control. The low-pass
filter network restricts the frequencies that will enter the
op amp and hence be amplified; the corner frequency is
simply (R 2 C) −1 . If the circuit designer needs to allow the
user to also select the break frequency for the filter, R 2
may be replaced by a potentiometer, or, alternatively, C
could be replaced by a variable capacitor. The remaining
stages are constructed in essentially the same way, but
with a different filter network at the input.
In order to keep the resistors, capacitors, and op amps
separate, we should add an appropriate subscript to each
as an indication of the stage to which it belongs (t, m, b).
Beginning with the treble stage, we have already en-
countered problems in using the μA741 in the 10 to
20 kHz range at high gain, so perhaps the LF411 is a bet-
ter choice here as well. Selecting a treble cutoff fre-
quency of 5 kHz (there is some variation among values
selected by different audio circuit designers), we require
1
= 2π(5 × 10 3 ) = 3.142 × 10 4
R 2t C t
Arbitrarily selecting C t = 1 μF results in a required
value of 31.83 for R 2t . Selecting C b = 1 μF as well
(perhaps we can negotiate a quantity discount), we need
R 2b = 318.3 for a bass cutoff frequency of 500 Hz.
We leave the design of a suitable bandpass filter for the
reader.
The next part of our design is to choose suitable val-
ues for R 1t and R 1b , as well as the corresponding feed-
back resistors. Without any instructions to the contrary, it
is probably simplest to make both stages identical.
Therefore, we arbitrarily select both R 1t and R 1b as 1 k ,
and R f t and R f b as 10 k potentiometers (meaning that
the range will be from 0 to 10 k ). This allows the
volume of one signal to be up to 11 times louder than the
other. In case we need our design to be portable, we se-
lect ±9 V supply voltages, although this can be easily
changed if needed.
(Continued on next page)each 1 k resistor is then connected to the inverting
input of the summing amplifier stage. The appropriate
potentiometer for the summing amplifier stage must be
selected in order to prevent saturation, so that knowledge
of both the input voltage range and the output speaker
wattage is required. A limited simulation of the final
design is shown in Fig. 16.46.
Now that the design of the filter stage is complete, we
are ready to consider the design of the summing stage.
For the sake of simplicity, we should power this op amp
stage with the same voltage sources as the other stages,
which limits the maximum output voltage magnitude to
less than 9 V. We use an inverting op amp configuration,
with the output of each of the filter op amp stages fed di-
rectly into its own 1 k resistor. The other terminal of

16.8 ADVANCED FILTER DESIGN
•
Although the basic filters we have encountered so far function adequately for
a number of applications, their characteristics are far from an ideal “step-
function-like” magnitude response. Fortunately, we have alternatives—
known as higher-order filters—with improved behavior, at the cost of
increased complexity and more components. For example, the general low-
pass filter transfer function of order n may be written as
N(s) =
K a 0
s n + a n−1 s n−1 + · · · + a 1 s + a 0
and that of the general high-pass filter (of order n) is only subtly different:
N(s) =
s n
+ a n−1

and (b) Chebyshev filters. All filters were normalized to a corner frequency of 1 rad/s.
To represent a bandpass filter, we need only alter the numerator to K s n/2 ,
and the band-reject filter (shown in Fig. 16.35d) has the transfer function
n/2
N(s) =
K s 2 + ω 0 2
s n + a n−1 s n−1 + · · · + a 1 s + a 0
Design of a specific filter, then, requires selecting the appropriate transfer
function, and choosing a class of polynomials which specify the coefficients
a 1 , a 2 , etc. In this section, we introduce filters based on Butterworth and
Chebyshev polynomials, two of the most commonly employed in filter design.
The low-pass Butterworth filter is one of the best-known filters. It is
characterized by an amplitude magnitude
K
|H( jω)| =
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
1 + (ω/ω c ) 2n
which is sketched in Fig. 16.47a for n = 1, 2, 3, and 5; K is a real constant,
and ω c represents the critical frequency. As can be seen, the magnitude
approaches a step-function-like shape as the order n increases. In contrast,
the low-pass Chebyshev filter is characterized by rather prominent ripples
in the passband, the number of which depends upon the order of the filter as
illustrated in Fig. 16.47b. Its magnitude response is described by
|H( jω)| =
K
1 +
β 2 C n 2 (ω/ω c )
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
where β is a real constant known as the ripple factor and C n (ω/ω c ) denotes
the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of degree n. For convenience,
selected coefficients of both polynomial types are listed in Table 16.2.
The Sallen-Key Amplifier
As seen in Sec. 15.8, we may create an op-amp-based filter circuit having a
double pole simply by cascading two circuits such as the one shown in
Fig. 15.49a, in which case we obtain a transfer function

explore the design of a second-order Butterworth low-pass filter.SECTION 16.8 ADVANCED FILTER DESIGN

EXAMPLE 16.14
Design a second-order low-pass Butterworth filte having a gain of
4 and a corner frequency at 1400 rad/s.
We begin by selecting the Sallen-Key prototype shown in Fig. 16.48,
and opt for the simplification which arises when we set R 1 = R 2 = R
and C 1 = C 2 = C. With a second-order Butterworth filter we expect
from Table 16.2 to have a denominator polynomial

We first set values for the two resistors in our gain network (which do
not need to undergo scaling) by arbitrarily choosing R B = 1 k , so that
R A = 586 .
Next, we note that if C = 1 F, then R = 1 , neither of which is a
particularly conventional value. Instead we select C = 1 μF; this
requires scaling the resistor by 10 6 . We also need to frequency-scale
to 1400 rad/s. Thus,
10 −6 F =

and k m = 714 . Consequently, R = k m R = 714 .
Unfortunately, our design is not quite done. We were constrained to
an amplifier gain of 1.586, or 4 dB, but the specifications called for a
gain of 4, or 12 dB. The only option available to us is to feed the output
of our circuit into a noninverting amplifier such as the one in Fig. 6.6a.
Choosing 1 k and 1.52 k for R 1 (output stage) and R f completes the
design.

and C 2 with resistors, and resistors R 1 and R 2 with capacitors. The remain-
der of the circuit remains unchanged. Nodal analysis of the resulting circuit
with C 1 = C 2 = C and R 1 = R 2 = R yields

as we found for the low-pass filter.
Higher-order filters can be realized by cascading appropriate op amp
stages. For example, Butterworth filters of odd order (e.g., 3, 5, . . .) require
an additional pole at s = −1. Thus, a third-order Butterworth filter is
constructed using a Sallen-Key stage which provides a transfer function
denominator D(s) of
s 2 + s + 1
(s + 1) s 3 + 2s 2 + 2s + 1
or
D(s) = s 2 + s + 1
[43]
with an additional op amp stage such as the one in Fig. 15.49a to provide the
term (s + 1).
EXAMPLE 16.15
Design a third-order low-pass Butterworth filte having a voltage
gain magnitude of 4 and a corner frequency at 2000 rad/s.
We begin by again selecting the Sallen-Key prototype shown in
Fig. 16.48, and opt for the simplification which arises when we set
R 1 = R 2 = R and C 1 = C 2 = C . We will also add an input stage of the
form shown in Fig. 15.49a to add the necessary pole. The basic design
is shown in Fig. 16.49.

Comparing Eqs. [41], [42], and [43], we determine that our design must
ensure that
1 =
1
R 2 C 2
and
1 =
3 − G
RC
Consequently, RC = 1 and G = 4. If we choose R A = 3 k , it follows
that R B = 1 k . We may scale these values later if we choose when
adjusting for operation at 2000 rad/s, but this is unnecessary as the dc
gain is set by the ratio of the two resistors.
Initially we design for R = 1 and C = 1 F as this automatically
satifies the RC = 1 requirement. Neither value being easy to locate,
however, we select a more reasonable capacitor value of 0.1 μF, which
combined with our frequency scaling factor k f = 2000, results in a
resistor scaling factor k m = 5000. Thus, R = 5 k in our final design.
All that remains is to select values for R 1 , R f , and C f in our front-
end stage. Recall that the transfer function of this stage is
−
1/R 1 C f
s + (1/R f C f )
Setting R f = 1 and C f = 1 F initially allows the pole to be properly
located prior to scaling operations, which dictate that we build the
circuit with R f = 5 k and C f = 0.1 μF. Our only remaining choice,
then, is to ensure that R 1 allows us to meet our gain requirement of 4.
Since we have already achieved this with our Sallen-Key stage, R 1
must be equal to R f , or 5 k .
Design of Chebyshev filters proceeds along the same lines as that of
Butterworth filters, except we have more choices now with the ripple factor.
Also, for filters not having a 3 dB ripple factor, the critical frequency is
where the ripple channel in the passband terminates, which is slightly dif-
ferent than what we have specified previously. Filters with order n > 2 are
constructed by cascading stages, either multiple Sallen-Key stages for even
orders, or a simple stage such as Fig. 15.49a in conjunction with the appro-
priate number of Sallen-Key stages for odd orders. For filters with a specific
gain requirement, an op amp stage containing only resistors is typically
required at the output.
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
We began this chapter with a short discussion of resonance. Of course the
reader was likely to already have an intuitive understanding of the basic
concept—timing when to kick our legs on a swing as a child; watching
videos of crystal glasses shattering under the power of a trained soprano’s
voice; instinctively slowing down when driving over a corrugated surface. In

CHAPTER 16 FREQUENCY RESPONSE
the context of linear circuit analysis, we found (perhaps surprisingly) that a
frequency can be chosen even for networks with capacitors and inductors
such that the voltage and current are in phase (hence the network appears
purely resistive at that particular frequency). How quickly our circuit
response changes as we move “off resonance” was related to a new term—
the quality factor (Q) of our circuit. After defining what is meant by critical
frequencies for our circuit response, we introduced the concept of bandwidth,
and discovered that our expressions may be simplified rather dramatically for
high-Q (Q > 5) circuits. We briefly extended this discussion to consider the
differences between series and parallel circuits near resonance, along with
more practical networks which cannot be classed as either.
The remainder of this chapter dealt with the analysis and design of filter
circuits. Prior to launching into that discussion, the topic of “scaled” circuit
components dealt with both frequency and magnitude scaling as a conve-
nient design tool. We also introduced the handy method of Bode plots,
which allows us to quickly sketch a reasonable approximation to the
response of a filter circuit as a function of frequency. We next considered
both passive and active filters starting with simple designs using a single
capacitor to achieve either low-pass or high-pass behavior. Shortly there-
after, bandpass filte design was studied. Although they are straightforward
to work with, the response of such simple circuits is not particularly abrupt.
As an alternative, filter designs based on either Butterworth or Chebyshev
polynomials were examined, with higher-order filters yielding sharper mag-
nitude response at the expense of increased complexity.

Resonance is the condition in which a fixed-amplitude sinusoidal
forcing function produces a response of maximum amplitude.
(Example 16.1)
An electrical network is in resonance when the voltage and current at
the network input terminals are in phase. (Example 16.1)
The quality factor is proportional to the maximum energy stored in a
network divided by the total energy lost per period.
A half-power frequency is defined as the frequency at √ which the mag-
nitude of a circuit response function is reduced to 1/ 2 times its maxi-
mum value.
A high-Q circuit is a resonant circuit in which the quality factor
is ≥ 5. (Example 16.2)
The bandwidth of a resonant circuit is defined as the difference
between the upper and lower half-power frequencies.
In a high-Q circuit, each half-power frequency is located approximately
one-half bandwidth from the resonant frequency. (Example 16.2)
A series resonant circuit is characterized by a low impedance at
resonance, whereas a parallel resonant circuit is characterized by a
high impedance at resonance. (Examples 16.1 and 16.3)
A series resonant circuit and a parallel resonant circuit are equivalent if
R p = R s (1 + Q 2 ) and X p = X s (1 + Q −2 ). (Examples 16.4, 16.5)
Impractical values for components often make design easier. The trans-
fer function of a network may be scaled in magnitude or frequency
using appropriate replacement values for components. (Example 16.6)679

Bode diagrams allow the rough shape of a transfer function to be
plotted quickly from the poles and zeros. (Examples 16.7, 16.8,
16.9, 16.10)
The four basic types of filters are low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and
bandstop. (Examples 16.11, 16.12)
Passive filters use only resistors, capacitors, and inductors; active
filters are based on op amps or other active elements. (Example 16.13)
Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can be designed based on the simple
Sallen-Key amplifier. Filter gain typically must be adjusted by adding a
purely resistor-based amplifier circuit at the output.

KEY CONCEPTS
INTRODUCTION
A general network having two pairs of terminals, one often labeled
the “input terminals’’ and the other the “output terminals,’’ is a
very important building block in electronic systems, communica-
tion systems, automatic control systems, transmission and distribu-
tion systems, or other systems in which an electrical signal or elec-
tric energy enters the input terminals, is acted upon by the network,
and leaves via the output terminals. The output terminal pair may
very well connect with the input terminal pair of another network.
When we studied the concept of Thévenin and Norton equivalent
networks in Chap. 5, we were introduced to the idea that it is not
always necessary to know the detailed workings of part of a circuit.
This chapter extends such concepts to linear networks, resulting in
parameters that allow us to predict how any network will interact
with other networks.

Using Network Parameters
A pair of terminals at which a signal may enter or leave a network
is called a port, and a network having only one such pair of terminals
is called a one-port network, or simply a one-port. No connections
may be made to any other nodes internal to the one-port, and it is
therefore evident that i a must equal i b in the one-port shown in
Fig. 17.1a. When more than one pair of terminals is present, the
network is known as a multiport network. The two-port network to
which this chapter is principally devoted is shown in Fig. 17.1b. The
currents in the two leads making up each port must be equal, and so it
follows that i a = i b and i c = i d in the two-port shown in Fig. 17.1b.
Sources and loads must be connected directly across the two termi-
nals of a port if the methods of this chapter are to be used. In other

words, each port can be connected only to a one-port network or to a port of
another multiport network. For example, no device may be connected
between terminals a and c of the two-port network in Fig. 17.1b. If such a cir-
cuit must be analyzed, general loop or nodal equations should be written.
Some of the introductory study of one- and two-port networks is ac-
complished best by using a generalized network notation and the abbrevi-
ated nomenclature for determinants introduced in Appendix 2. Thus, if we
write a set of loop equations for a passive network,

Here N loops have been assumed, the currents appear in subscript order in
each equation, and the order of the equations is the same as that of the cur-
rents. We also assume that KVL is applied so that the sign of each Z ii term
(Z 11 , Z 22 , . . . , Z N N ) is positive; the sign of any Z i j (i = j) or mutual term
may be either positive or negative, depending on the reference directions
assigned to I i and I j .
If there are dependent sources within the network, then it is possible that
not all the coefficients in the loop equations must be resistances or impedances.
Even so, we will continue to refer to the circuit determinant as Z .
The use of minor notation (Appendix 2) allows for the input or driving-
point impedance at the terminals of a one-port network to be expressed very
concisely. The result is also applicable to a two-port network if one of the two
ports is terminated in a passive impedance, including an open or a short circuit.
Let us suppose that the one-port network shown in Fig. 17.2 is com-
posed entirely of passive elements and dependent sources; linearity is also
assumed. An ideal voltage source V 1 is connected to the port, and the source
current is identified as the current in loop 1. Employing Cramer’s rule, then,

built using operational amplifiers. These exercises illustrate that negative
resistances may be obtained from networks whose only passive circuit
elements are resistors, and that inductors may be simulated with only resis-
tors and capacitors.

ADMITTANCE PARAMETERS
Let us now turn our attention to two-port networks. We will assume in all
that follows that the network is composed of linear elements and contains
no independent sources; dependent sources are permissible, however. Fur-
ther conditions will also be placed on the network in some special cases.693
SECTION 17.2 ADMITTANCE PARAMETERS
We will consider the two-port as it is shown in Fig. 17.8; the voltage and
current at the input terminals are V 1 and I 1 , and V 2 and I 2 are specified at the
output port. The directions of I 1 and I 2 are both customarily selected as into
the network at the upper conductors (and out at the lower conductors). Since
the network is linear and contains no independent sources within it, I 1 may
be considered to be the superposition of two components, one caused by V 1
and the other by V 2 . When the same argument is applied to I 2 , we may begin
with the set of equations
I 1 = y 11 V 1 + y 12 V 2 [5]
I 2 = y 21 V 1 + y 22 V 2 [6]

where the y’s are no more than proportionality constants, or unknown coef-
ficients, for the present. However, it should be clear that their dimensions
must be A/V, or S. They are therefore called the y (or admittance) param-
eters, and are defined by Eqs. [5] and [6].
The y parameters, as well as other sets of parameters we will define later
in the chapter, are represented concisely as matrices. Here, we define the
(2 × 1) column matrix I,
I =
I 1
I 2
[7]
the (2 × 2) square matrix of the y parameters,
y 11
y 21
y =
y 12
y 22
[8]
and the (2 × 1) column matrix V,
V =
V 1
V 2
[9]
Thus, we may write the matrix equation I = yV, or
I 1
I 2
=
y 11
y 21
y 12
y 22
V 1
V 2
and matrix multiplication of the right-hand side gives us the equality
I 1
I 2
=
y 11 V 1 + y 12 V 2
y 21 V 1 + y 22 V 2
These (2 × 1) matrices must be equal, element by element, and thus we are
led to the defining equations, [5] and [6].
The most useful and informative way to attach a physical meaning to the
y parameters is through a direct inspection of Eqs. [5] and [6]. Consider
Eq. [5], for example; if we let V 2 be zero, then we see that y 11 must be given
by the ratio of I 1 to V 1 . We therefore describe y 11 as the admittance measured
at the input terminals with the output terminals short-circuited (V 2 = 0).
Since there can be no question which terminals are short-circuited, y 11 is
best described as the short-circuit input admittance. Alternatively, we might
describe y 11 as the reciprocal of the input impedance measured with the out-
put terminals short-circuited, but a description as an admittance is obviously
more direct. It is not the name of the parameter that is important. Rather, it
The notation adopted in this text to represent a matrix
is standard, but also can be easily confused with our
previous notation for phasors or general complex
quantities. The nature of any such symbol should be
clear from the context in which it is used.694
CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS
is the conditions which must be applied to Eq. [5] or [6], and hence to the
network, that are most meaningful; when the conditions are determined, the
parameter can be found directly from an analysis of the circuit (or by exper-
iment on the physical circuit). Each of the y parameters may be described as
a current-voltage ratio with either V 1
0 (the input terminals short-
circuited) or V 2 0 (the output terminals short-circuited):
y 11 = I 1
V 1 V 2 =0
y 12 = I 1
V 2 V 1 =0
y 21 = I 2
V 1 V 2 =0
y 22 = I 2
V 2 V 1 =0
[10]
[11]
[12]
[13]
Because each parameter is an admittance which is obtained by short-
circuiting either the output or the input port, the y parameters are known as
the short-circuit admittance parameters. The specific name of y 11 is the
short-circuit input admittance, y 22 is the short-circuit output admittance,
and y 12 and y 21 are the short-circuit transfer admittances.

Find the four short-circuit admittance parameters for the resistive
two-port shown in Fig. 17.9.
The values of the parameters may be easily established by applying
Eqs. [10] to [13], which we obtained directly from the defining equa-
tions, [5] and [6]. To determine y 11 , we short-circuit the output and find
the ratio of I 1 to V 1 . This may be done by letting V 1 1 V, for then
y 11 = I 1 . By inspection of Fig. 17.9, it is apparent that 1 V applied at
the input with the output short-circuited will cause an input current of

at the output terminals. The input current flows through the short circuit

and is I 1 = − 10
y 12 = −0.1 S
By similar methods,
y 21 = −0.1 S
y 22 = 0.15 S
The describing equations for this two-port in terms of the admittance
parameters are, therefore,
I 1 = 0.3V 1 − 0.1V 2 [14]

In general, it is easier to use Eq. [10], [11], [12], or [13] when only one
parameter is desired. If we need all of them, however, it is usually easier to
assign V 1 and V 2 to the input and output nodes, to assign other node-to-
reference voltages at any interior nodes, and then to carry through with the
general solution.
In order to see what use might be made of such a system of equations,
let us now terminate each port with some specific one-port network.696

■ FIGURE 17.11 The resistive two-port network of Fig. 17.9, terminated
with specific one-port networks.
Consider the simple two-port network of Example 17.4, shown in
Fig. 17.11 with a practical current source connected to the input port and a
resistive load connected to the output port. A relationship must now exist
between V 1 and I 1 that is independent of the two-port network. This rela-
tionship may be determined solely from this external circuit. If we apply
KCL (or write a single nodal equation) at the input,
I 1 = 15 − 0.1V 1
For the output, Ohm’s law yields
I 2 = −0.25V 2
Substituting these expressions for I 1 and I 2 in Eqs. [14] and [15], we have
15 = 0.4V 1 − 0.1V 2
0 = −0.1V 1 + 0.4V 2
from which are obtained
V 1 = 40 V
V 2 = 10 V
The input and output currents are also easily found:
I 1 = 11 A
I 2 = −2.5 A
and the complete terminal characteristics of this resistive two-port are then
known.
The advantages of two-port analysis do not show up very strongly for
such a simple example, but it should be apparent that once the y parameters
are determined for a more complicated two-port, the performance of the
two-port for different terminal conditions is easily determined; it is neces-
sary only to relate V 1 to I 1 at the input and V 2 to I 2 at the output.
In the example just concluded, y 12 and y 21 were both found to be −0.1 S.
It is not difficult to show that this equality is also obtained if three general
impedances Z A , Z B , and Z C are contained in this network. It is somewhat
more difficult to determine the specific conditions which are necessary in
order that y 12 = y 21 , but the use of determinant notation is of some help. Let
us see if the relationships of Eqs. [10] to [13] can be expressed in terms of
the impedance determinant and its minors.
Since our concern is with the two-port and not with the specific net-
works with which it is terminated, we will let V 1 and V 2 be represented by
two ideal voltage sources. Equation [10] is applied by letting V 2 0 (thus
short-circuiting the output) and finding the input admittance. The network
now, however, is simply a one-port, and the input impedance of a one-port
was found in Sec. 17.1. We select loop 1 to include the input terminals, and
let I 1 be that loop’s current; we identify (−I 2 ) as the loop current in loop 2SECTION 17.2 ADMITTANCE PARAMETERS

CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS
Their equality is shown by first interchanging the rows and columns of one
minor (for example, 21 ), an operation which any college algebra book
proves is valid, and then letting every mutual impedance Z ij be replaced by
Z ji . Thus, we set
Z 12 = Z 21
Z 23 = Z 32
etc.
This equality of Z ij and Z ji is evident for the three familiar passive
elements—the resistor, capacitor, and inductor—and it is also true for
mutual inductance. However, it is not true for every type of device which we
may wish to include inside a two-port network. Specifically, it is not true in
general for a dependent source, and it is not true for the gyrator, a useful
model for Hall-effect devices and for waveguide sections containing fer-
rites. Over a narrow range of radian frequencies, the gyrator provides an
additional phase shift of 180° for a signal passing from the output to the
input over that for a signal in the forward direction, and thus y 12 = −y 21 .
A common type of passive element leading to the inequality of Z ij and Z ji ,
however, is a nonlinear element.
Any device for which Z ij = Z ji is called a bilateral element, and a circuit
which contains only bilateral elements is called a bilateral circuit. We have
therefore shown that an important property of a bilateral two-port is
y 12 = y 21
and this property is glorified by stating it as the reciprocity theorem:
Another way of stating the theorem is to say that the
interchange of an ideal voltage source and an ideal
ammeter in any passive, linear, bilateral circuit will not
change the ammeter reading.
In any passive linear bilateral network, if the single voltage source V x
in branch x produces the current response I y in branch y, then the
removal of the voltage source from branch x and its insertion in branch
y will produce the current response I y in branch x.
If we had been working with the admittance determinant of the circuit and
had proved that the minors 21 and 12 of the admittance determinant Y
were equal, then we should have obtained the reciprocity theorem in its dual
form:
In other words, the interchange of an ideal current
source and an ideal voltmeter in any passive linear
bilateral circuit will not change the voltmeter reading.
In any passive linear bilateral network, if the single current source I x
between nodes x and x produces the voltage response V y between
nodes y and y , then the removal of the current source from nodes x and
x and its insertion between nodes y and y will produce the voltage re-
sponse V y between nodes x and x .

equations, eliminate V x to obtain two equations, and then rearrange
these equations into the form of Eqs. [5] and [6] so that all four y

SOME EQUIVALENT NETWORKS
When analyzing electronic circuits, it is often necessary to replace the
active device (and perhaps some of its associated passive circuitry) with an
equivalent two-port containing only three or four impedances. The validity
of the equivalent may be restricted to small signal amplitudes and a single
frequency, or perhaps a limited range of frequencies. The equivalent is also
a linear approximation of a nonlinear circuit. However, if we are faced with
a network containing a number of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, plus a
transistor labeled 2N3823, then we cannot analyze the circuit by any of
the techniques we have studied previously; the transistor must first be re-
placed by a linear model, just as we replaced the op amp by a linear model
in Chap. 6. The y parameters provide one such model in the form of a two-
port network that is often used at high frequencies. Another common linear
model for a transistor appears in Sec. 17.5.
The two equations that determine the short-circuit admittance parameters,
I 1 = y 11 V 1 + y 12 V 2 [16]
I 2 = y 21 V 1 + y 22 V 2 [17]
have the form of a pair of nodal equations written for a circuit containing two
nonreference nodes. The determination of an equivalent circuit that leads to
Eqs. [16] and [17] is made more difficult by the inequality, in general, of y 12
and y 21 ; it helps to resort to a little trickery in order to obtain a pair of equa-
tions that possess equal mutual coefficients. Let us both add and subtract
y 12 V 1 (the term we would like to see present on the right side of Eq. [17]):
or
I 2 = y 12 V 1 + y 22 V 2 + (y 21 − y 12 )V 1 [18]
I 2 − (y 21 − y 12 )V 1 = y 12 V 1 + y 22 V 2 [19]
The right-hand sides of Eqs. [16] and [19] now show the proper symmetry
for a bilateral circuit; the left-hand side of Eq. [19] may be interpreted as the
algebraic sum of two current sources, one an independent source I 2 entering
node 2, and the other a dependent source (y 21 − y 12 )V 1 leaving node 2.
Let us now “read’’ the equivalent network from Eqs. [16] and [19]. We
first provide a reference node, and then a node labeled V 1 and one labeled V 2 .

(a) and the three-terminal Y network (b) are equivalent
if the six impedances satisfy the conditions of the Y-
(or -T) transformation, Eqs. [20] to [25].
From Eq. [16], we establish the current I 1 flowing into node 1, we supply a
mutual admittance (−y 12 ) between nodes 1 and 2, and we supply an admit-
tance of (y 11 + y 12 ) between node 1 and the reference node. With V 2 0,
the ratio of I 1 to V 1 is then y 11 , as it should be. Now consider Eq. [19]; we
cause the current I 2 to flow into the second node, we cause the current
(y 21 − y 12 )V 1 to leave the node, we note that the proper admittance (−y 12 )
exists between the nodes, and we complete the circuit by installing the ad-
mittance (y 22 + y 12 ) from node 2 to the reference node. The completed cir-
cuit is shown in Fig. 17.13a.
Another form of equivalent network is obtained by subtracting and
adding y 21 V 2 in Eq. [16]; this equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 17.13b. If
the two-port is bilateral, then y 12 = y 21 , and either of the equivalents
reduces to a simple passive network. The dependent source disappears.
This equivalent of the bilateral two-port is shown in Fig. 17.13c.
There are several uses to which these equivalent circuits may be put. In
the first place, we have succeeded in showing that an equivalent of any
complicated linear two-port exists. It does not matter how many nodes or
loops are contained within the network; the equivalent is no more complex
than the circuits of Fig. 17.13. One of these may be much simpler to use
than the given circuit if we are interested only in the terminal characteristics
of the given network.
The three-terminal network shown in Fig. 17.14a is often referred to as
a of impedances, while that in Fig. 17.14b is called a Y. One network may
be replaced by the other if certain specific relationships between the imped-
ances are satisfied, and these interrelationships may be established by use of
the y parameters. We find that

Z 3 = Z C Z A

The reader may recall these useful relationships from
Chap. 5, where their derivation was described.
These equations enable us to transform easily between the equivalent Y and
networks, a process known as the Y- transformation (or -T transfor-
mation if the networks are drawn in the forms of those letters). In going
from Y to , Eqs. [20] to [22], first find the value of the common numera-
tor as the sum of the products of the impedances in the Y taken two at a
time. Each impedance in the is then found by dividing the numerator by
the impedance of that element in the Y which has no common node with the
desired element. Conversely, given the , first take the sum of the three
impedances around the ; then divide the product of the two impedances
having a common node with the desired Y element by that sum.
These transformations are often useful in simplifying passive networks,
particularly resistive ones, thus avoiding the need for any mesh or nodal
analysis.

CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS
We first make a -Y transformation on the upper appearing in
Fig. 17.15a. The sum of the three resistances forming this is
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 . The product of the two resistors connected to the
top node is 1 × 4 = 4 2 . Thus, the upper resistor of the Y is 48 , or 12
Repeating this procedure for the other two resistors, we obtain the
network shown in Fig. 17.15b.
We next make the series and parallel combinations indicated,
obtaining in succession Fig. 17.15c and d. Thus, the input resistance
of the circuit in Fig. 17.15a is found to be 159
71 , or 2.24 .
.
Now let us tackle a slightly more complicated example, shown as
Fig. 17.16. We note that the circuit contains a dependent source, and thus the
Y- transformation is not applicable.
EXAMPLE 17.7
The circuit shown in Fig. 17.16 is an approximate linear equivalent
of a transistor amplifie in which the emitter terminal is the bottom
node, the base terminal is the upper input node, and the collector
terminal is the upper output node. A 2000 resistor is connected
between collector and base for some special application and makes
the analysis of the circuit more difficult. Determine the y param
eters for this circuit.

᭤ Identify the goal of the problem.
Cutting through the problem-specific jargon, we realize that we have
been presented with a two-port network and require the y parameters.
᭤ Collect the known information.
Figure 17.16 shows a two-port network with V 1 , I 1 , V 2 , and I 2 already
indicated, and a value for each component has been provided.
᭤ Devise a plan.
There are several ways we might think about this circuit. If we
recognize it as being in the form of the equivalent circuit shown in
Fig. 17.13a, then we may immediately determine the values of the
y parameters. If recognition is not immediate, then the y parametersSECTION 17.3 SOME EQUIVALENT NETWORKS
may be determined for the two-port by applying the relationships of
Eqs. [10] to [13]. We also might avoid any use of two-port analysis
methods and write equations directly for the circuit as it stands. The
first option seems best in this case.
᭤ Construct an appropriate set of equations.
By inspection, we find that −y 21 corresponds to the admittance of
our 2 k resistor, that y 11 + y 12 corresponds to the admittance of the
500 resistor, the gain of the dependent current source corresponds
to y 21 − y 12 , and finally that y 22 + y 12 corresponds to the admittance
of the 10 k resistor. Hence we may write
1
y 12 = − 2000
y 11 =

y 21 = 0.0395 + y 12

᭤ Determine if additional information is required.
With the equations written as they are, we see that once y 12 is com-
puted, the remaining y parameters may also be obtained.
᭤ Attempt a solution.
Plugging the numbers into a calculator, we find that

I 2 = 39V 1 + 0.6V 2 [27]
where we are now using units of mA, V, and mS or k .

CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS
Now let us make use of Eqs. [26] and [27] by analyzing the performance
of the two-port in Fig. 17.16 under several different operating conditions.
We first provide a current source of 1/0 ◦ mA at the input and connect a
0.5 k (2 mS) load to the output. The terminating networks are therefore
both one-ports and give us the following specific information relating I 1 to
V 1 and I 2 to V 2 :
I 1 = 1 (for any V 1 )
I 2 = −2V 2
We now have four equations in the four variables, V 1 , V 2 , I 1 , and I 2 . Sub-
stituting the two one-port relationships in Eqs. [26] and [27], we obtain two
equations relating V 1 and V 2 :
1 = 2.5V 1 − 0.5V 2
0 = 39V 1 + 2.6V 2
Solving, we find that
V 1 = 0.1 V
I 1 = 1 mA
V 2 = −1.5 V
I 2 = 3 mA
These four values apply to the two-port operating with a prescribed input
(I 1 1 mA) and a specified load (R L = 0.5 k ).
The performance of an amplifier is often described by giving a few spe-
cific values. Let us calculate four of these values for this two-port with its
terminations. We will define and evaluate the voltage gain, the current gain,
the power gain, and the input impedance.
The voltage gain G V is
G V =
V 2
V 1
From the numerical results, it is easy to see that G V = −15.
The current gain G I is defined as
G I =
I 2
I 1
and we have
G I = 3
Let us define and calculate the power gain G P for an assumed sinusoidal
excitation. We have
G P =
Re − 12 V 2 I ∗ 2
P out
= 45
=
P in
Re 12 V 1 I ∗ 1
The device might be termed either a voltage, a current, or a power amplifier,
since all the gains are greater than unity. If the 2 k resistor were removed,
the power gain would rise to 354.
The input and output impedances of the amplifier are often desired in or-
der that maximum power transfer may be achieved to or from an adjacent
two-port. We define the input impedance Z in as the ratio of input voltage to
current:
Z in =
V 1
= 0.1 k
I 1SECTION 17.3 SOME EQUIVALENT NETWORKS
This is the impedance offered to the current source when the 500 load is
connected to the output. (With the output short-circuited, the input imped-
ance is necessarily 1/y 11 , or 400 .)
It should be noted that the input impedance cannot be determined by
replacing every source with its internal impedance and then combining
resistances or conductances. In the given circuit, such a procedure would
yield a value of 416 . The error, of course, comes from treating the
dependent source as an independent source. If we think of the input imped-
ance as being numerically equal to the input voltage produced by an input
current of 1 A, the application of the 1 A source produces some input volt-
age V 1 , and the strength of the dependent source (0.0395V 1 ) cannot be zero.
We should recall that when we obtain the Thévenin equivalent impedance
of a circuit containing a dependent source along with one or more indepen-
dent sources, we must replace the independent sources with short circuits or
open circuits, but a dependent source must not be deactivated. Of course, if
the voltage or current on which the dependent source depends is zero, then
the dependent source will itself be inactive; occasionally a circuit may be
simplified by recognizing such an occurrence.
Besides G V , G I , G P , and Z in , there is one other performance parameter
that is quite useful. This is the output impedance Z out , and it is determined
for a different circuit configuration.
The output impedance is just another term for the Thévenin impedance
appearing in the Thévenin equivalent circuit of that portion of the network
faced by the load. In our circuit, which we have assumed is driven by a
1/0 ◦ mA current source, we therefore replace this independent source with
an open circuit, leave the dependent source alone, and seek the input im-
pedance seen looking to the left from the output terminals (with the load
removed). Thus, we define
Z out = V 2 | I 2 =1 A with all other independent sources deactivated and
R L removed
We therefore remove the load resistor, apply 1/0 ◦ mA (since we are work-
ing in V, mA, and k ) at the output terminals, and determine V 2 . We place
these requirements on Eqs. [26] and [27], and obtain
0 = 2.5V 1 − 0.5V 2
1 = 39V 1 + 0.6V 2
Solving,
V 2 = 0.1190 V
and thus
Z out = 0.1190 k
An alternative procedure might be to find the open-circuit output volt-
age and the short-circuit output current. That is, the Thévenin impedance is
the output impedance:
Z out = Z th = −
V 2oc
I 2sc
Carrying out this procedure, we first rekindle the independent source so that
I 1 1 mA, and then open-circuit the load so that I 2 0. We have

0 = 39V 1 + 0.6V 2

We now have enough information to enable us to draw the Thévenin
or Norton equivalent of the two-port of Fig. 17.16 when it is driven by a
1/0 ◦ mA current source and terminated in a 500 load. Thus, the Norton
equivalent presented to the load must contain a current source equal to the
short-circuit current I 2sc in parallel with the output impedance; this equiva-
lent is shown in Fig. 17.17a. Also, the Thévenin equivalent offered to the
1/0 ◦ mA input source must consist solely of the input impedance, as drawn
in Fig. 17.17b.
Before leaving the y parameters, we should recognize their usefulness in
describing the parallel connection of two-ports, as indicated in Fig. 17.18.
When we first defined a port in Sec. 17.1, we noted that the currents enter-
ing and leaving the two terminals of a port had to be equal, and there could
be no external connections made that bridged between ports. Apparently the
parallel connection shown in Fig. 17.18 violates this condition. However, if
each two-port has a reference node that is common to its input and output
port, and if the two-ports are connected in parallel so that they have a com-
mon reference node, then all ports remain ports after the connection. Thus,

But

Thus,

and we see that each y parameter of the parallel network is given as the sum
of the corresponding parameters of the individual networks,
y = y A + y B
[28]
This may be extended to any number of two-ports connected in parallel.

IMPEDANCE PARAMETERS
The concept of two-port parameters has been introduced in terms of the
short-circuit admittance parameters. There are other sets of parameters,
however, and each set is associated with a particular class of networks for
which its use provides the simplest analysis. We will consider three other
types of parameters, the open-circuit impedance parameters, which are the
subject of this section; and the hybrid and the transmission parameters,
which are discussed in following sections.
We begin again with a general linear two-port that does not contain any
independent sources; the currents and voltages are assigned as before
(Fig. 17.8). Now let us consider the voltage V 1 as the response produced by
two current sources I 1 and I 2 . We thus write for V 1
V 1 = z 11 I 1 + z 12 I 2 [29]
V 2 = z 21 I 1 + z 22 I 2 [30]
and for V 2
or
V =

V 2
= zI =

I 2
[31]
Of course, in using these equations it is not necessary that I 1 and I 2 be
current sources; nor is it necessary that V 1 and V 2 be voltage sources. In
general, we may have any networks terminating the two-port at either end.
As the equations are written, we probably think of V 1 and V 2 as given quan-
tities, or independent variables, and I 1 and I 2 as unknowns, or dependent
variables.
The six ways in which two equations may be written to relate these four
quantities define the different systems of parameters. We study the four
most important of these six systems of parameters.
The most informative description of the z parameters, defined in
Eqs. [29] and [30], is obtained by setting each of the currents equal to zero.
Thus
z 11 = V 1
I 1 I 2 =0
z 12 = V 1
I 2 I 1 =0
z 21 = V 2
I 1 I 2 =0
z 22 = V 2
I 2 I 1 =0

Since zero current results from an open-circuit termination, the z param-
eters are known as the open-circuit impedance parameters. They are easily
related to the short-circuit admittance parameters by solving Eqs. [29] and709

In a similar manner, the z parameters may be expressed in terms of the
admittance parameters. Transformations of this nature are possible between
any of the various parameter systems, and quite a collection of occasionally
useful formulas may be obtained. Transformations between the y and z pa-
rameters (as well as the h and t parameters which we will consider in the
following sections) are given in Table 17.1 as a helpful reference.

CHAPTER 17 TWO-PORT NETWORKS
If the two-port is a bilateral network, reciprocity is present; it is easy to
show that this results in the equality of z 12 and z 21 .
Equivalent circuits may again be obtained from an inspection of
Eqs. [29] and [30]; their construction is facilitated by adding and subtract-
ing either z 12 I 1 in Eq. [30] or z 21 I 2 in Eq. [29]. Each of these equivalent
circuits contains a dependent voltage source.
Let us leave the derivation of such an equivalent to some leisure
moment, and consider next an example of a rather general nature. Can we
construct a general Thévenin equivalent of the two-port, as viewed from
the output terminals? It is necessary first to assume a specific input circuit
configuration, and we will select an independent voltage source V s (positive
sign at top) in series with a generator impedance Z g . Thus
V s = V 1 + I 1 Z g
Combining this result with Eqs. [29] and [30], we may eliminate V 1 and I 1
and obtain
V 2 =

The Thévenin equivalent circuit may be drawn directly from this equation;
it is shown in Fig. 17.21. The output impedance, expressed in terms of the z
parameters, is

which is representative of a bipolar junction transistor operating in

and power gains, as well as the input and output impedances. The
two-port is driven by an ideal sinusoidal voltage source V s in series
with a 500 resistor, and terminated in a 10 k load resistor.
The two describing equations for the two-port are
V 1 = 10 3 I 1 + 10I 2
[36]
V 2 = −10 I 1 + 10 I 2
6

[37]SECTION 17.4 IMPEDANCE PARAMETERS
and the characterizing equations of the input and output networks are
V s = 500I 1 + V 1 [38]
V 2 = −10 4 I 2 [39]
From these last four equations, we may easily obtain expressions for
V 1 , I 1 , V 2 , and I 2 in terms of V s :
V 1 = 0.75V s
I 1 =
V 2 = −250V s

and the input impedance,

The output impedance may be obtained by referring to Fig. 17.21:
Z out = z 22 −
z 12 z 21
= 16.67 k
z 11 + Z g
In accordance with the predictions of the maximum power transfer
theorem, the power gain reaches a maximum value when Z L = Z ∗ out =
16.67 k ; that maximum value is 17,045.
The y parameters are useful when two-ports are interconnected in paral-
lel, and, in a dual manner, the z parameters simplify the problem of a series
connection of networks, shown in Fig. 17.22. Note that the series connection
is not the same as the cascade connection that we will discuss later in con-
nection with the transmission parameters. If each two-port has a common
reference node for its input and output, and if the references are connected
together as indicated in Fig. 17.22, then I 1 flows through the input ports of
the two networks in series. A similar statement holds for I 2 . Thus, ports
remain ports after the interconnection. It follows that I = I A = I B and
V = V A + V B = z A I A + z B I B
= (z A + z B )I = zI

SECTION 17.5 HYBRID PARAMETERS

HYBRID PARAMETERS
The difficulty in measuring quantities such as the open-circuit impedance
parameters arises when a parameter such as z 21 must be measured. A known
sinusoidal current is easily supplied at the input terminals, but because of
the exceedingly high output impedance of the transistor circuit, it is difficult
to open-circuit the output terminals and yet supply the necessary dc biasing
voltages and measure the sinusoidal output voltage. A short-circuit current
measurement at the output terminals is much simpler to implement.
The hybrid parameters are defined by writing the pair of equations relat-
ing V 1 , I 1 , V 2 , and I 2 as if V 1 and I 2 were the independent variables:
V 1 = h 11 I 1 + h 12 V 2 [40]
I 2 = h 21 I 1 + h 22 V 2 [41]
or
V 1
I 2
= h
I 1
V 2
[42]
The nature of the parameters is made clear by first setting V 2 = 0. Thus,
h 11 = V 1
I 1
h 21 = I 2
I 1
V 2 =0
V 2 =0

= short-circuit forward current gain
Letting I 1 = 0, we obtain
h 12 = V 1
V 2
h 22 = I 2
V 2
I 1 =0
I 1 =0
= open-circuit reverse voltage gain
= open-circuit output admittance
Since the parameters represent an impedance, an admittance, a voltage gain,
and a current gain, they are called the “hybrid’’ parameters.
The subscript designations for these parameters are often simplified
when they are applied to transistors. Thus, h 11 , h 12 , h 21 , and h 22 become h i ,
h r , h f , and h o , respectively, where the subscripts denote input, reverse, for-
ward, and output.
EXAMPLE 17.9
Find h for the bilateral resistive circuit drawn in Fig. 17.24.
With the output short-circuited (V 2 = 0), the application of a 1 A
source at the input (I 1 = 1 A) produces an input voltage of 3.4 V
(V 1 = 3.4 V); hence, h 11 = 3.4 . Under these same conditions, the
output current is easily obtained by current division: I 2 = −0.4 A; thus,
h 21 = −0.4.
The remaining two parameters are obtained with the input open-
circuited (I 1 = 0). We apply 1 V to the output terminals (V 2 = 1 V).

The response at the input terminals is 0.4 V (V 1 = 0.4 V), and thus
h 12 0.4. The current delivered by this source at the output terminals
is 0.1 A (I 2 = 0.1 A), and therefore h 22 0.1 S.
We therefore have h =

The circuit shown in Fig. 17.26 is a direct translation of the two defining
equations, [40] and [41]. The first represents KVL about the input loop,
while the second is obtained from KCL at the upper output node. This
circuit is also a popular transistor equivalent circuit. Let us assume some
reasonable values for the common-emitter configuration: h 11 = 1200 ,
h 12 = 2 × 10 −4 , h 21 = 50, h 22 = 50 × 10 −6 S, a voltage generator of
1/0 ◦ mV in series with 800 , and a 5 k load. For the input,
10 −3 = (1200 + 800)I 1 + 2 × 10 −4 V 2

Characterizing Transistors
Parameter values for bipolar junction transistors are
commonly quoted in terms of h parameters. Invented
in the late 1940s by researchers at Bell Laboratories
(Fig. 17.27), the transistor is a nonlinear three-terminal
passive semiconductor device that forms the basis for al-
most all amplifiers and digital logic circuits.
are valid for all voltages and currents is not possible.
Therefore, it is common practice to quote h parameters
at a specific value of collector current I C and collector-
emitter voltage V CE . Another consequence of the nonlin-
earity of the device is that ac h parameters and dc h
parameters are often quite different in value.
There are many types of instruments which may be
employed to obtain the h parameters for a particular
transistor. One example is a semiconductor parameter
analyzer, shown in Fig. 17.29. This instrument sweeps
the desired current (plotted on the vertical axis) against a
specified voltage (plotted on the horizontal axis). A
“family” of curves is produced by varying a third param-
eter, often the base current, in discrete steps.
As an example, the manufacturer of the 2N3904 NPN
silicon transistor quotes h parameters as indicated in
Table 17.2; note that the specific parameters are given
alternative designations (h ie , h re , etc.) by transistor
engineers. The measurements were made at I C = 1.0 mA,
V CE = 10 V dc, and f = 1.0 kHz.
■ FIGURE 17.27 Photograph of the first demonstrated bipolar junction
transistor (“bjt”).

The three terminals of a transistor are labeled the
base (b), collector (c), and emitter (e) as shown in
Fig. 17.28, and are named after their roles in the trans-
port of charge within the device. The h parameters of a
bipolar junction transistor are typically measured with
the emitter terminal grounded, also known as the
common-emitter configuration; the base is then desig-
nated as the input and the collector as the output. As
mentioned previously, however, the transistor is a non-
linear device, and so definition of h parameters which

Just for fun, one of the authors and a friend decided
to measure these parameters for themselves. Grabbing
an inexpensive device off the shelf and using the instru-
ment in Fig. 17.29, they found
h oe = 3.3 μmhos h f e = 109
h ie = 3.02 k h re = 4 × 10 −3
(Continued on next page)TABLE ● 17.2 Summary of 2N3904 AC Parameters

h ie (h 11 ) Input impedance 1.0–10
h re (h 12 ) Voltage feedback ratio 0.5–8.0 × 10 −4
h fe (h 21 ) Small-signal current gain 100–400
h oe (h 22 ) Output admittance 1.0–40
the first three of which were all well within the manufac-
turer’s published tolerances, although much closer to the
minimum values than to the maximum values. The value
for h re , however, was an order of magnitude larger than
the maximum value specified by the manufacturer’s
datasheet! This was rather disconcerting, as we thought
we were doing pretty well up to that point.
Upon further reflection, we realized that the experi-
mental setup allowed the device to heat up during the

measurement, as we were sweeping below and above
I C = 1 mA. Transistors, unfortunately, can change their
properties rather dramatically as a function of tempera-
ture; the manufacturer values were specifically for 25 ◦ C.
Once the sweep was changed to minimize device heat-
ing, we obtained a value of 2.0 × 10 −4 for h re . Linear cir-
cuits are by far much easier to work with, but nonlinear
circuits can be much more interesting!
Solving,
I 1 = 0.510 μA
I 2 = 20.4 μA
V 1 = 0.592 mV
V 2 = −102 mV
Through the transistor we have a current gain of 40, a voltage gain of −172,
and a power gain of 6880. The input impedance to the transistor is 1160 ,
and a few more calculations show that the output impedance is 22.2 k .
Hybrid parameters may be added directly when two-ports are connected
in series at the input and in parallel at the output. This is called a series-
parallel interconnection, and it is not used very often.

TRANSMISSION PARAMETERS
The last two-port parameters that we will consider are called the t param-
eters, the ABCD parameters, or simply the transmission parameters. They
are defined by
V 1 = t 11 V 2 − t 12 I 2 [43]
I 1 = t 21 V 2 − t 22 I 2 [44]
and
or
V 1

where V 1 , V 2 , I 1 , and I 2 are defined as usual (Fig. 17.8). The minus signs
that appear in Eqs. [43] and [44] should be associated with the output717
SECTION 17.6 TRANSMISSION PARAMETERS
current, as (−I 2 ). Thus, both I 1 and −I 2 are directed to the right, the direc-
tion of energy or signal transmission.
Other widely used nomenclature for this set of parameters is
t 11
t 21
t 12
t 22
=

C D
[46]
Note that there are no minus signs in the t or ABCD matrices.
Looking again at Eqs. [43] to [45], we see that the quantities on the left,
often thought of as the given or independent variables, are the input voltage
and current, V 1 and I 1 ; the dependent variables, V 2 and I 2 , are the output
quantities. Thus, the transmission parameters provide a direct relationship
between input and output. Their major use arises in transmission-line analy-
sis and in cascaded networks.
Let us find the t parameters for the bilateral resistive two-port of
Fig. 17.30a. To illustrate one possible procedure for finding a single param-
eter, consider

If it is necessary to find all four parameters, we write any convenient
pair of equations using all four terminal quantities, V 1 , V 2 , I 1 , and I 2 . From
Fig. 17.30a, we have two mesh equations:
V 1 = 12I 1 + 10I 2 [47]
V 2 = 10I 1 + 14I 2 [48]
Solving Eq. [48] for I 1 , we get
I 1 = 0.1V 2 − 1.4I 2
so that t 21 = 0.1 S and t 22 = 1.4. Substituting the expression for I 1 in
Eq. [47], we find
V 1 = 12(0.1V 2 − 1.4I 2 ) + 10I 2 = 1.2V 2 − 6.8I 2
and t 11 1.2 and t 12 = 6.8 , once again.
For reciprocal networks, the determinant of the t matrix is equal to unity:

We therefore short-circuit the output (V 2 = 0) and set V 1 1 V, as shown in
Fig. 17.30b. Note that we cannot set the denominator equal to unity by plac-
ing a 1 A current source at the output; we already have a short circuit there.
The equivalent resistance offered to the 1 V source is R eq = 2 + (4 10) ,

We conclude our two-port discussion by connecting two two-ports in

the opportunity for vastly simplified analysis of cascaded two-port
network circuits. As seen in this section, where, for example,

we found that the t parameters characterizing the cascaded network can
be found by simply multiplying t A and t B :

Such matrix operations are easily carried out using scientific calculators
or software packages such as MATLAB. The MATLAB script,

In terms of entering matrices in MATLAB, each has a case-sensitive
variable name (tA, tB, and t in this example). Matrix elements are en-
tered a row at a time, beginning with the top row; rows are separated by
a semicolon. Again, the reader should always be careful to remember
that the order to operations is critical when performing matrix algebra.
For example, tB*tA results in a totally different matrix than the one we
sought:
t B ؒ t A

For simple matrices such as seen in this example, a scientific calculator
is just as handy (if not more so). However, larger cascaded networks
are more easily handled on a computer, where it is more convenient to
see all arrays on the screen simultaneously.
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
In this chapter we encountered a somewhat abstract way to represent net-
works. This new approach is especially useful if the network is passive, and
will either be connected somehow to other networks at some point, or
perhaps component values will frequently be changed. We introduced the
concept through the idea of a one-port network, where all we really did was
determine the Thévenin equivalent resistance (or impedance, more generally
speaking). Our first exposure to the idea of a two-port network (perhaps one
port is an input, the other an output?) was through admittance parameters,
also called y parameters. The result is a matrix which, when multiplied by
the vector containing the terminal voltages, yields a vector with the currents
into each port. A little manipulation yielded what we called -Y equivalents
in Chap. 5. The direct counterpart to y parameters are z parameters, where
each matrix element is the ratio of a voltage to a current. Occasionally y and
z parameters are not particularly convenient, so we also introduced
“hybrid” or h parameters, as well as “transmission” or t parameters, also
referred to as ABCD parameters.
Table 17.1 summarizes the conversion process between y, z, h, and
t parameters; having one set of parameters which completely describes a
network is sufficent regardless of what type of matrix we prefer for a partic-
ular analysis.READING FURTHER
As a convenience to the reader, we will now proceed directly to a list of
key concepts in the chapter, along with correponding examples.
❑ In order to employ the analysis methods described in this chapter, it is
critical to remember that each port can only be connected to either a
one-port network or a port of another multiport network.
❑ The input impedance of a one-port (passive) linear network can be
obtained using either nodal or mesh analysis; in some instances the set
of coefficients can be written directly by inspection. (Examples 17.1,
17.2, 17.3)
❑ The defining equations for analyzing a two-port network in terms of its
admittance (y) parameters are:
I 1 = y 11 V 1 + y 12 V 2
and
I 2 = y 21 V 1 + y 22 V 2
where
❑
y 11 = I 1
V 1
y 21 = I 2
V 1
V 2 =0
and
V 2 =0
y 22 = I 2
V 2 V 1 =0
and
V 2 = z 21 I 1 + z 22 I 2
and
I 2 = h 21 I 1 + h 22 V 2
(Example 17.9)
The defining equations for analyzing a two-port network in terms of
its transmission (t) parameters (also called the ABCD parameters)
are:
V 1 = t 11 V 2 − t 12 I 2
❑
V 1 =0
(Example 17.8)
The defining equations for analyzing a two-port network in terms of its
hybrid (h) parameters are:
V 1 = h 11 I 1 + h 12 V 2
❑
I 1
V 2
(Examples 17.4, 17.5, 17.7)
The defining equations for analyzing a two-port network in terms of its
impedance (z) parameters are:
V 1 = z 11 I 1 + z 12 I 2
❑
y 12 =
and
I 1 = t 21 V 2 − t 22 I 2
(Example 17.10)
It is straightforward to convert between h, z, t, and y parameters,
depending on circuit analysis needs; the transformations are
summarized in Table 17.1. (Example 17.6)

20. The metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), a three-
terminal nonlinear element used in many electronics applications, is often
specified in terms of its y parameters. The ac parameters are strongly
dependent on the measurement conditions, and commonly named y is , y rs ,
y f s , and y os , as in
I g = y is V gs + y rs V ds [49]
I d = y f s V gs + y os V ds [50]
where I g is the transistor gate current, I d is the transistor drain current, and the
third terminal (the source) is common to the input and output during the mea-
surement. Thus, V gs is the voltage between the gate and the source, and V ds is
the voltage between the drain and the source. The typical high-frequency
model used to approximate the behavior of a MOSFET is shown in Fig. 17.48.

INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we continue our introduction to circuit analysis by
studying periodic functions in both the time and frequency domains.
Specifically, we will consider forcing functions which are periodic and
have functional natures which satisfy certain mathematical restrictions
that are characteristic of any function which we can generate in the
laboratory. Such functions may be represented as the sum of an infinite
number of sine and cosine functions which are harmonically related.
Therefore, since the forced response to each sinusoidal component can
be determined easily by sinusoidal steady-state analysis, the response
of the linear network to the general periodic forcing function may be
obtained by superposing the partial responses.
The topic of Fourier series is of vital importance in a number of
fields, particularly communications. The use of Fourier-based tech-
niques to assist in circuit analysis, however, had been slowly falling
out of fashion for a number of years. Now as we face an increas-
ingly larger fraction of global power usage coming from equipment
employing pulse-modulated power supplies (e.g., computers), the
subject of harmonics in power systems and power electronics is
rapidly becoming a serious problem in even large-scale generation
plants. It is only with Fourier-based analysis that the underlying
problems and possible solutions can be understood.

We know that the complete response of a linear circuit to an arbi-
trary forcing function is composed of the sum of a forced response
and a natural response. The natural response has been considered
733734
CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
both in the time domain (Chaps. 7, 8, and 9) and in the frequency domain
(Chaps. 14 and 15). The forced response has also been considered from sev-
eral perspectives, including the phasor-based techniques of Chap. 10. As we
have discovered, in some cases we need both components of the total re-
sponse of a particular circuit, while in others we need only the natural or the
forced response. In this section, we refocus our attention on forcing func-
tions that are sinusoidal in nature, and discover how to write a general peri-
odic function as a sum of such functions—leading us into a discussion of a
new set of circuit analysis procedures.
Harmonics
Some feeling for the validity of representing a general periodic function by an
infinite sum of sine and cosine functions may be gained by considering a sim-
ple example. Let us first assume a cosine function of radian frequency ω 0 ,
v 1 (t) = 2 cos ω 0 t
where
ω 0 = 2π f 0
and the period T is
T =
1
2π
=
f 0
ω 0
Although T does not usually carry a zero subscript, it is the period of the
fundamental frequency. The harmonics of this sinusoid have frequencies
nω 0 , where ω 0 is the fundamental frequency and n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . The
frequency of the first harmonic is the fundamental frequency.
Next let us select a third-harmonic voltage
v 3a (t) = cos 3ω 0 t
The fundamental v 1 (t), the third harmonic v 3a (t), and the sum of these two
waves are shown as functions of time in Fig. 18.1a. Note that the sum is also
periodic, with period T = 2π/ω 0 .
The form of the resultant periodic function changes as the phase and
amplitude of the third-harmonic component change. Thus, Fig. 18.1b shows
the effect of combining v 1 (t)and a third harmonic of slightly larger amplitude,
v 3b (t) = 1.5 cos 3ω 0 t
By shifting the phase of the third harmonic by 90 degrees to give
v 3c (t) = sin 3ω 0 t
the sum, shown in Fig. 18.1c, takes on a still different character. In all cases,
the period of the resultant waveform is the same as the period of the funda-
mental waveform. The nature of the waveform depends on the amplitude
and phase of every possible harmonic component, and we will find that
we are able to generate waveforms which have extremely nonsinusoidal
characteristics by an appropriate combination of sinusoidal functions.
After we have become familiar with the use of the sum of an infinite
number of sine and cosine functions to represent a periodic waveform, we
will consider the frequency-domain representation of a general nonperiodic
waveform in a manner similar to the Laplace transform.735

The Fourier Series
We first consider a periodic function f (t), defined in Sec. 11.2 by the func-
tional relationship
f (t) = f (t + T )
␻ 0 t736
CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
where T is the period. We further assume that the function f (t) satisfies the
following properties:
We will take f(t) to represent either a voltage or a
current waveform, and any such waveform which we
can actually produce must satisfy these four conditions;
perhaps it should be noted, however, that certain
mathematical functions do exist for which these four
conditions are not satisfied.
f (t) is single-valued everywhere; that is, f (t) satisfies the mathe-
matical definition of a function.
t +T
2. The integral t 0 0 | f (t)| dt exists (i.e., is not infinite) for any
choice of t 0 .
3. f (t) has a finite number of discontinuities in any one period.
4. f (t) has a finite number of maxima and minima in any one period.
1.
Given such a periodic function f (t), the Fourier theorem states that f (t)
may be represented by the infinite series
f (t) = a 0 + a 1 cos ω 0 t + a 2 cos 2ω 0 t + · · ·

where the fundamental frequency ω 0 is related to the period T by

T
and where a 0 , a n , and b n are constants that depend upon n and f (t). Equa-
tion [1] is the trigonometric form of the Fourier series for f (t), and the
process of determining the values of the constants a 0 , a n , and b n is called
Fourier analysis. Our object is not the proof of this theorem, but only a sim-
ple development of the procedures of Fourier analysis and a feeling that the
theorem is plausible.
Some Useful Trigonometric Integrals
Before we discuss the evaluation of the constants appearing in the Fourier
series, let us collect a set of useful trigonometric integrals. We let both n and
k represent any element of the set of integers 1, 2, 3, . . . . In the following
integrals, 0 and T are used as the integration limits, but it is understood that
any interval of one period is equally correct.

Evaluation of the Fourier Coefficients
The evaluation of the unknown constants in the Fourier series may now be
accomplished readily. We first attack a 0 . If we integrate each side of Eq. [1]
over a full period, we obtain

This constant a 0 is simply the average value of f (t) over a period, and we
therefore describe it as the dc component of f (t).
To evaluate one of the cosine coefficients, for example, a k , the coefficient
of cos kω 0 t, we first multiply each side of Eq. [1] by cos kω 0 t and then
integrate both sides of the equation over a full period:

From Eqs. [3], [4], and [6] we note that every term on the right-hand side of
this equation is zero except for the single a n term where k = n. We evaluate
that term using Eq. [8], and in so doing we find a k , or a n :
a n =

CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
This result is twice the average value of the product f (t) cos nω 0 t over a
period.
In a similar way, we obtain b k by multiplying by sin kω 0 t, integrating
over a period, noting that all but one of the terms on the right-hand side are
zero, and performing that single integration by Eq. [7]. The result is
b n =

EXAMPLE 18.1
The “half-sinusoidal” waveform shown in Fig. 18.2 represents the
voltage response obtained at the output of a half-wave rectifie
circuit, a nonlinear circuit whose purpose is to convert a sinusoidal
input voltage to a (pulsating) approximation to dc. Find the Fourier
series representation of this waveform.
᭤ Identify the goal of the problem.
We are presented with a periodic function and are asked to find the
Fourier series representation. If not for the removal of all negative
voltages, the problem would be trivial, as only one sinusoid would be
required.

SECTION 18.1 TRIGONOMETRIC FORM OF THE FOURIER SERIES
᭤ Collect the known information.
In order to represent this voltage as a Fourier series, we must first
determine the period and then express the graphical voltage as an
analytical function of time. From the graph, the period is seen to be
T = 0.4 s
and thus
f 0 = 2.5 Hz
and
ω 0 = 5π rad/s
᭤ Devise a plan.
The most straightforward approach is to apply Eqs. [9] to [11] to
calculate the set of coefficients a 0 , a n , and b n . To do this, we need a
functional expression for v(t), the most straightforward being defined
over the interval t = 0 to t = 0.4 as

⎨ V m cos 5πt
v(t) = 0
0.1 ≤ t ≤ 0.3
⎩
V m cos 5πt
0.3 ≤ t ≤ 0.4
However, choosing the period to extend from t = −0.1 to t = 0.3
will result in fewer equations and, hence, fewer integrals:
v(t) =
−0.1 ≤ t ≤ 0.1
0.1 ≤ t ≤ 0.3

[12]
This form is preferable, although either description will yield the
correct results.

Line and Phase Spectra
We depicted the function v(t) of Example 18.1 graphically in Fig. 18.2, and
analytically in Eq. [12]—both representations being in the time domain. The
Fourier series representation of v(t) given in Eq. [16] is also a time-domain
expression, but may be transformed into a frequency-domain representation
as well. For example, Fig. 18.5 shows the amplitude of each frequency
component of v(t), a type of plot known as a line spectrum. Here, the mag-
nitude of each frequency component (i.e., |a 0 |, |a 1 |, etc.) is indicated by the
length of the vertical line at the corresponding frequency ( f 0 , f 1 , etc.); for the
sake of convenience, we have taken V m = 1. Given a different value of V m ,
we simply scale the y axis values by the new value.

the first seven frequency components. A magnitude of V m = 1 has been chosen for
convenience.
Such a plot, sometimes referred to as a discrete spectrum, gives a great
deal of information at a glance. In particular, we can see how many terms of
the series are required to obtain a reasonable approximation of the original
waveform. In the line spectrum of Fig. 18.5, we note that the 8th and 10th
harmonics (20 and 25 Hz, respectively) add only a small correction. Trun-
cating the series after the 6th harmonic therefore should lead to a reasonable
approximation; the reader can judge this for herself/himself by considering
Fig. 18.3.
One note of caution must be injected. The example we have considered
contains no sine terms, and the amplitude of the nth harmonic is therefore
|a n |. If b n is not zero, then the amplitude of the component at a frequency
nω 0 must be a n 2 + b n 2 . This is the general quantity which we must show in
a line spectrum. When we discuss the complex form of the Fourier series,
we will see that this amplitude is obtained more directly.
In addition to the amplitude spectrum, we may construct a discrete phase
spectrum. At any frequency nω 0 , we combine the cosine and sine terms to
determine the phase angle φ n :
a n cos nω 0 t + b n sin nω 0 t =

no odd harmonics (except the fundamental) among the cosine terms. It is743

possible to anticipate the absence of certain terms in a Fourier series, before any
integrations are performed, by an inspection of the symmetry of the given time
function. We will investigate the use of symmetry in the following section.

Even and Odd Symmetry
The two types of symmetry which are most readily recognized are even-
function symmetry and odd-function symmetry, or simply even symmetry and
odd symmetry. We say that f (t) possesses the property of even symmetry if
f (t) = f (−t)
f (t) = − f (−t)
[18]
In other words, if t is replaced by (−t), then the negative
of the given func-
√
tion is obtained; for example, t, sin t , t cos 70t , t 1 + t 2 , and the function
sketched in Fig. 18.6b are all odd functions and possess odd symmetry. The
graphical characteristics of odd symmetry are apparent if the portion of
f (t) for t > 0 is rotated about the positive t axis and the resultant figure is
then rotated about the f (t) axis; the two curves will fit exactly, one on top
of the other. That is, we now have symmetry about the origin, rather than
about the f (t) axis as we did for even functions.
Having definitions for even and odd symmetry, we should note that the
product of two functions with even symmetry, or of two functions with odd
symmetry, yields a function with even symmetry. Furthermore, the product
of an even and an odd function gives a function with odd symmetry.
Symmetry and Fourier Series Terms
Now let us investigate the effect that even symmetry produces in a Fourier
series. If we think of the expression which equates an even function f (t)
and the sum of an infinite number of sine and cosine functions, then it is
apparent that the sum must also be an even function. A sine wave, however,
is an odd function, and no sum of sine waves can produce any even function
other than zero (which is both even and odd). It is thus plausible that the
Fourier series of any even function is composed of only a constant and
cosine functions. Let us now show carefully that b n = 0. We have

Such functions as t 2 , cos 3t, ln(cos t), sin 2 7t, and a constant C all possess
even symmetry; the replacement of t by (−t) does not change the value of
any of these functions. This type of symmetry may also be recognized
graphically, for if f (t) = f (−t), then mirror symmetry exists about the
f (t) axis. The function shown in Fig. 18.6a possesses even symmetry; if the
figure were to be folded along the f (t) axis, then the portions of the graph
for positive and negative time would fit exactly, one on top of the other.
We define odd symmetry by stating that if odd symmetry is a property of
f (t), then

f (t) sin nω 0 t dt

and
b n = 0
(even sym.)
[19]
No sine terms are present. Therefore, if f (t) shows even symmetry, then
b n = 0; conversely, if b n = 0, then f (t) must have even symmetry.
A similar examination of the expression for a n leads to an integral over
the half period extending from t = 0 to t = 12 T :

The fact that a n may be obtained for an even function by taking “twice the
integral over half the range’’ should seem logical.
A function having odd symmetry can contain no constant term or cosine
terms in its Fourier expansion. Let us prove the second part of this state-
ment. We have

SECTION 18.2 THE USE OF SYMMETRY
A similar, but simpler, proof shows that
a 0 = 0
(odd sym.)
With odd symmetry, therefore, a n = 0 and a 0 = 0; conversely, if a n = 0
and a 0 = 0, odd symmetry is present.
The values of b n may again be obtained by integrating over half the range:
b n =

Half-Wave Symmetry
The Fourier series for both of these square waves have one other interesting
characteristic: neither contains any even harmonics. 1 That is, the only fre-
quency components present in the series have frequencies which are odd
multiples of the fundamental frequency; a n and b n are zero for even values
of n. This result is caused by another type of symmetry, called half-wave
symmetry. We will say that f (t) possesses half-wave symmetry if
–T

(a)
f (t) = − f t − 12 T
f (t)
or the equivalent expression,
f (t) = − f t + 12 T
Except for a change of sign, each half cycle is like the adjacent half cycles.
Half-wave symmetry, unlike even and odd symmetry, is not a function
of the choice of the point t = 0. Thus, we can state that the square wave
(Fig. 18.4a or b) shows half-wave symmetry. Neither waveform shown in
Fig. 18.6 has half-wave symmetry, but the two somewhat similar functions
plotted in Fig. 18.7 do possess half-wave symmetry.
It may be shown that the Fourier series of any function which has half-
wave symmetry contains only odd harmonics. Let us consider the coeffi-
cients a n . We have again

half-wave symmetry. When a waveform possesses half-wave symmetry
and either even or odd symmetry, then it is possible to reconstruct the
waveform if the function is known over any quarter-period interval. The

COMPLETE RESPONSE TO PERIODIC
• FORCING FUNCTIONS
Through the use of the Fourier series, we may now express an arbitrary
periodic forcing function as the sum of an infinite number of sinusoidal
forcing functions. The forced response to each of these functions may be
determined by conventional steady-state analysis, and the form of the nat-
ural response may be determined from the poles of an appropriate network
transfer function. The initial conditions existing throughout the network,
including the initial value of the forced response, enable the amplitude of
the natural response to be selected; the complete response is then obtained
as the sum of the forced and natural responses.
EXAMPLE 18.2
For the circuit of Fig. 18.8a, determine the periodic response i(t)
corresponding to the forcing function shown in Fig. 18.8b if i(0) ‫؍‬ 0.

i n (t) = Ae −2t

In obtaining this solution, we have had to use many of the most general
concepts introduced in this and the preceding 17 chapters. Some we did not
have to use because of the simple nature of this particular circuit, but their
places in the general analysis were indicated. In this sense, we may look
upon the solution of this problem as a significant achievement in our intro-
ductory study of circuit analysis. In spite of this glorious feeling of accom-
plishment, however, it must be pointed out that the complete response, as
obtained in Example 18.2 in analytical form, is not of much value as it
stands; it furnishes no clear picture of the nature of the response. What we
really need is a sketch of i(t) as a function of time. This may be obtained by
a laborious calculation at a sufficient number of instants of time; a desktop
computer or a programmable calculator can be of great assistance here. The
sketch may be approximated by the graphical addition of the natural re-
sponse, the dc term, and the first few harmonics; this is an unrewarding task.
When all is said and done, the most informative solution of this problem
is probably obtained by making a repeated transient analysis. That is, the
form of the response can certainly be calculated in the interval from t = 0
to t = π/2 s; it is an exponential rising toward 2.5 A. After determining the
749750
CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
value at the end of this first interval, we have an initial condition for the next
(π/2)-second interval. The process is repeated until the response assumes a
generally periodic nature. The method is eminently suitable to this example,
for there is negligible change in the current waveform in the successive
periods π/2 < t < 3π/2 and 3π/2 < t < 5π/2. The complete current
response is sketched in Fig. 18.9.

COMPLEX FORM OF THE FOURIER SERIES
In obtaining a frequency spectrum, we have seen that the amplitude of each
frequency component depends on both a n and b n ; that is, the sine term and
the cosine term both contribute to the amplitude. The exact expression for
this amplitude is a n 2 + b n 2 . It is also possible to obtain the amplitude
directly by using a form of Fourier series in which each term is a cosine
function with a phase angle; the amplitude and phase angle are functions of
f (t) and n. An even more convenient and concise form of the Fourier series
is obtained if the sines and cosines are expressed as exponential functions
with complex multiplying constants.
Let us first take the trigonometric form of the Fourier series:
The reader may recall the identities
sin α =
e j α − e − j α
j 2
and
cos α =
e j α
+ e − j α
2
f (t) = a 0 +

(a n cos nω 0 t + b n sin nω 0 t)

and then substitute the exponential forms for the sine and cosine. After
rearranging,
f (t) = a 0 +
∞
n=1
e jnω 0 t
a n − jb n
a n + jb n
+ e − jnω 0 t

2SECTION 18.4 COMPLEX FORM OF THE FOURIER SERIES
We now define a complex constant c n :
c n = 12 (a n − jb n )
(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
[27]
The values of a n , b n , and c n all depend on n and f (t). Suppose we now
replace n with (−n); how do the values of the constants change? The coef-
ficients a n and b n are defined by Eqs. [10] and [11], and it is evident that
a −n = a n
but
b −n = −b n
From Eq. [27], then,
c −n = 12 (a n + jb n )
(n = 1, 2, 3, . . .)
[28]
Thus,
c n = c ∗−n
We also let
c 0 = a 0
We may therefore express f (t) as
∞
f (t) = c 0 +
∞
c n e jnω 0 t +
n=1
c −n e − jnω 0 t
n=1
or
f (t) =
∞
∞
c n e jnω 0 t +
n=0
n=1
c −n e − jnω 0 t
Finally, instead of summing the second series over the positive integers
from 1 to ∞, let us sum over the negative integers from −1 to −∞:
f (t) =
∞
c n e jnω 0 t +
n=0
−∞
c n e jnω 0 t
n=−1
or
f (t) =
∞
n=−∞
c n e jnω 0 t
[29]
By agreement, a summation from −∞ to ∞ is understood to include a term
for n = 0.
Equation [29] is the complex form of the Fourier series for f (t); its con-
ciseness is one of the most important reasons for its use. In order to obtain
the expression by which a particular complex coefficient c n may be evalu-
ated, we substitute Eqs. [10] and [11] in Eq. [27]:
c n =

and then we use the exponential equivalents of the sine and cosine and
simplify:
c n =
1
T
T /2
−T /2
f (t)e − jnω 0 t dt
[30]
Thus, a single concise equation serves to replace the two equations required
for the trigonometric form of the Fourier series. Instead of evaluating two
integrals to find the Fourier coefficients, only one integration is required;
moreover, it is almost always a simpler integration. It should be noted that
the integral of Eq. [30] contains the multiplying factor 1/T , whereas the in-
tegrals for a n and b n both contain the factor 2/T .
Collecting the two basic relationships for the exponential form of the
Fourier series, we have
f (t) =

where ω 0 = 2π/T as usual.
The amplitude of the component of the exponential Fourier series at
ω = nω 0 , where n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , is |c n |. We may plot a discrete
frequency spectrum giving |c n | versus nω 0 or nf 0 , using an abscissa that
shows both positive and negative values; and when we do this, the graph is
symmetrical about the origin, since Eqs. [27] and [28] show that |c n | = |c −n |.
We note also from Eqs. [29] and [30] that the amplitude of the sinusoidal
component at ω = nω 0 , where n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , is a n 2 + b n 2 = 2|c n | =
2|c −n | = |c n | + |c −n |. For the dc component, a 0 = c 0 .
The exponential Fourier coefficients, given by Eq. [30], are also affected
by the presence of certain symmetries in f (t). Thus, appropriate expres-
sions for c n are

EXAMPLE 18.4
A certain function f(t) is a train of rectangular pulses of amplitude
V 0 and duration τ, recurring periodically every T seconds, as
shown in Fig. 18.11. Find the exponential Fourier series for f(t).

Fourier series problem.
The Sampling Function
The trigonometric factor in Eq. [36] occurs frequently in modern communi-
cation theory, and it is called the sampling function. The “sampling” refers
to the time function of Fig. 18.11 from which the sampling function is
derived. The product of this sequence of pulses and any other function f (t)SECTION 18.4 COMPLEX FORM OF THE FOURIER SERIES
represents samples of f (t) every T seconds if τ is small and V 0 = 1. We
define
Sa(x) =
sin x
x
Because of the way in which it helps to determine the amplitude of the var-
ious frequency components in f (t), it is worth our while to discover the im-
portant characteristics of this function. First, we note that Sa(x) is zero
whenever x is an integral multiple of π ; that is,
Sa(nπ) = 0
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
When x is zero, the function is indeterminate, but it is easy to show that its
value is unity:
Sa(0) = 1
The magnitude of Sa(x) therefore decreases from unity at x = 0 to zero at
x = π . As x increases from π to 2π , |Sa(x)| increases from zero to a max-
imum less than unity, and then decreases to zero once again. As x continues
to increase, the successive maxima continually become smaller because the
numerator of Sa(x) cannot exceed unity and the denominator is continually
increasing. Also, Sa(x) shows even symmetry.
Now let us construct the line spectrum. We first consider |c n |, writing
Eq. [36] in terms of the fundamental cyclic frequency f 0 :
|c n | =
V 0 τ sin(nπf 0 τ )
T
nπf 0 τ
[38]
The amplitude of any c n is obtained from Eq. [38] by using the known
values τ and T = 1/ f 0 and selecting the desired value of n, n = 0, ±1,
±2, . . . . Instead of evaluating Eq. [38] at these discrete frequencies, let us
sketch the envelope of |c n | by considering the frequency n f 0 to be a contin-
uous variable. That is, f, which is n f 0 , can actually take on only the discrete
values of the harmonic frequencies 0, ± f 0 , ±2 f 0 , ±3 f 0 , and so forth,
but we may think of n for the moment as a continuous variable. When f is
zero, |c n | is evidently V 0 τ/T , and when f has increased to 1/τ , |c n | is
zero. The resultant envelope is first sketched as in Fig. 18.12a. The
line spectrum is then obtained by simply erecting a vertical line at each
harmonic frequency, as shown in the sketch. The amplitudes shown are
those of the c n . The particular case sketched applies to the case where
τ/T = 1/(1.5π) = 0.212. In this example, it happens that there is no har-
monic exactly at that frequency at which the envelope amplitude is zero;
another choice of τ or T could produce such an occurrence, however.
In Fig. 18.12b, the amplitude of the sinusoidal component is plotted as a
function of frequency. Note again that a 0 = c 0 and a n 2 + b n 2 = |c n | + |c −n |.
There are several observations and conclusions which we may make
about the line spectrum of a periodic sequence of rectangular pulses, as
given in Fig. 18.12b. With respect to the envelope of the discrete spectrum,
it is evident that the “width” of the envelope depends upon τ , and not upon
T. As a matter of fact, the shape of the envelope is not a function of T. It
follows that the bandwidth of a filter which is designed to pass the periodic
pulses is a function of the pulse width τ , but not of the pulse period T; an

inspection of Fig. 18.12b indicates that the required bandwidth is about
1/τ Hz. If the pulse period T is increased (or the pulse repetition frequency
f 0 is decreased), the bandwidth 1/τ does not change, but the number of
spectral lines between zero frequency and 1/τ Hz increases, albeit discon-
tinuously; the amplitude of each line is inversely proportional to T. Finally,
a shift in the time origin does not change the line spectrum; that is, |c n | is
not a function of t 0 . The relative phases of the frequency components do
change with the choice of t 0 .

DEFINITION OF THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
Now that we are familiar with the basic concepts of the Fourier series
representation of periodic functions, let us proceed to define the Fourier
transform by first recalling the spectrum of the periodic train of rectangular
pulses we obtained in Sec. 18.4. That was a discrete line spectrum, which is
the type that we must always obtain for periodic functions of time. The
spectrum was discrete in the sense that it was not a smooth or continuous
function of frequency; instead, it had nonzero values only at specific
frequencies.
There are many important forcing functions, however, that are not peri-
odic functions of time, such as a single rectangular pulse, a step function, a
ramp function, or the somewhat strange type of function called the impulse
function defined in Chap. 14. Frequency spectra may be obtained for such
nonperiodic functions, but they will be continuous spectra in which some
energy, in general, may be found in any nonzero frequency interval, no
matter how small.
We will develop this concept by beginning with a periodic function and
then letting the period become infinite. Our experience with periodic
rectangular pulses should indicate that the envelope will decrease in ampli-
tude without otherwise changing shape, and that more and more frequency
components will be found in any given frequency interval. In the limit, we
should expect an envelope of vanishingly small amplitude, filled with an
infinite number of frequency components separated by vanishingly small
frequency intervals. The number of frequency components between 0 and
100 Hz, for example, becomes infinite, but the amplitude of each one
approaches zero. At first thought, a spectrum of zero amplitude is a puzzling
concept. We know that the line spectrum of a periodic forcing function
shows the amplitude of each frequency component. But what does the zero-
amplitude continuous spectrum of a nonperiodic forcing function signify?
That question will be answered in the following section; now we proceed to
carry out the limiting procedure just suggested.

CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
We begin with the exponential form of the Fourier series:
f (t) =
∞
c n e jnω 0 t [39]
f (t)e −jnω 0 t dt [40]
2π
T [41]
n=−∞
where
c n =
1
T
T /2
−T /2
and
ω 0 =
We now let
T →∞
and thus, from Eq. [41], ω 0 must become vanishingly small. We represent
this limit by a differential:
ω 0 → dω
Thus

ω 0
dω
=

T
2π
2π
[42]
Finally, the frequency of any “harmonic” nω 0 must now correspond to the
general frequency variable which describes the continuous spectrum. In
other words, n must tend to infinity as ω 0 approaches zero, so that the prod-
uct is finite:
nω 0 → ω
[43]
When these four limiting operations are applied to Eq. [40], we find that
c n must approach zero, as we had previously presumed. If we multiply each
side of Eq. [40] by the period T and then undertake the limiting process, a
nontrivial result is obtained:
∞
c n T →
−∞
f (t)e − jωt dt
The right-hand side of this expression is a function of ω (and not of t), and
we represent it by F( jω):
F( jω) =
∞
f (t)e − jωt dt
−∞
[44]
Now let us apply the limiting process to Eq. [39]. We begin by multi-
plying and dividing the summation by T,
f (t) =
∞
n=−∞
c n Te jnω 0 t

next replacing c n T with the new quantity F( jω), and then making use of
expressions [42] and [43]. In the limit, the summation becomes an integral,
and
f (t) =

2π
∞
−∞
F( jω)e jωt dω
[45]SECTION 18.5 DEFINITION OF THE FOURIER TRANSFORM
Equations [44] and [45] are collectively called the Fourier transform pair.
The function F( jω) is the Fourier transform of f (t), and f (t) is the inverse
Fourier transform of F( jω).
This transform-pair relationship is very important! We should memorize
it, draw arrows pointing to it, and mentally keep it on the conscious level.
We emphasize the importance of these relations by repeating them in
boxed form:
F( jω) =

The reader may have already noticed a few similarities
between the Fourier transform and the Laplace trans-
form. Key differences between the two include the fact
that initial energy storage is not easily incorporated in
circuit analysis using Fourier transforms while it is very
easily incorporated in the case of Laplace transforms.
Also, there are several time functions (e.g., the
increasing exponential) for which a Fourier transform
does not exist. However, if it is spectral information as
opposed to transient response in which we are primarily
concerned, the Fourier transform is the ticket.
The exponential terms in these two equations carry opposite signs for the
exponents. To keep them straight, it may help to note that the positive sign
is associated with the expression for f (t), as it is with the complex Fourier
series, Eq. [39].
It is appropriate to raise one question at this time. For the Fourier trans-
form relationships of Eq. [46], can we obtain the Fourier transform of any
arbitrarily chosen f (t)? It turns out that the answer is affirmative for almost
any voltage or current that we can actually produce. A sufficient condition
for the existence of F( jω) is that
∞
−∞
| f (t)| dt < ∞
This condition is not necessary, however, because some functions that do
not meet it still have a Fourier transform; the step function is one such ex-
ample. Furthermore, we will see later that f (t) does not even need to be
nonperiodic in order to have a Fourier transform; the Fourier series repre-
sentation for a periodic time function is just a special case of the more gen-
eral Fourier transform representation.
As we indicated earlier, the Fourier transform-pair relationship is
unique. For a given f (t) there is one specific F( jω); and for a given F( jω)
there is one specific f (t).
EXAMPLE 18.5
Use the Fourier transform to obtain the continuous spectrum of the
single rectangular pulse Fig. 18.13a.
The pulse is a truncated version of the sequence considered previously
in Fig. 18.11, and is described by

it is of the form of the sampling function. The value of F(0) is V 0 τ . The

SOME PROPERTIES OF THE FOURIER
TRANSFORM
Our object in this section is to establish several of the mathematical proper-
ties of the Fourier transform and, even more important, to understand its
physical significance. We begin by using Euler’s identity to replace e − jωt in
Eq. [46a]:
F( jω) =
∞
−∞
f (t) cos ωt dt − j
∞
−∞
f (t) sin ωt dt
[47]
Since f (t), cos ωt, and sin ωt are all real functions of time, both the
integrals in Eq. [47] are real functions of ω. Thus, by letting
F( jω) = A(ω) + jB(ω) = |F( jω)|e jφ(ω)
[48]
we have
A(ω) =
∞
B(ω) = −
|F( jω)| =
f (t) cos ωt dt
−∞
∞
−∞
f (t) sin ωt dt
A 2 (ω) + B 2 (ω)
[49]
[50]
[51]
and
φ(ω) = tan −1
B(ω)
A(ω)
[52]
Replacing ω by −ω shows that A(ω) and |F( jω)| are both even functions
of ω, while B(ω) and φ(ω) are both odd functions of ω.
Now, if f (t) is an even function of t, then the integrand of Eq. [50] is an
odd function of t, and the symmetrical limits force B(ω) to be zero; thus, if
f (t) is even, its Fourier transform F( jω) is a real, even function of ω,
and the phase function φ(ω) is zero or π for all ω. However, if f (t) is an
761762
CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
odd function of t, then A(ω) = 0 and F( jω) is both odd and a pure imagi-
nary function of ω; φ(ω) is ±π/2. In general, however, F( jω) is a complex
function of ω.
Finally, we note that the replacement of ω by −ω in Eq. [47] forms the
conjugate of F( jω). Thus,
F(− jω) = A(ω) − jB(ω) = F ∗ ( jω)
and we have
F( jω)F(− jω) = F( jω)F ∗ ( jω) = A 2 (ω) + B 2 (ω) = |F( jω)| 2
Physical Significance of the Fourier Transform
With these basic mathematical properties of the Fourier transform in mind,
we are now ready to consider its physical significance. Let us suppose that
f (t) is either the voltage across or the current through a 1 resistor, so that
f 2 (t) is the instantaneous power delivered to the 1 resistor by f (t). Inte-
grating this power over all time, we obtain the total energy delivered by
f (t) to the 1 resistor,
∞
W 1 =
−∞
f 2 (t) dt
[53]
Now let us resort to a little trickery. Thinking of the integrand in Eq. [53] as
f (t) times itself, we replace one of those functions with Eq. [46b]:
∞
W 1 =
−∞
f (t)
∞

2π
−∞
e jωt F( jω) dω dt
Since f (t) is not a function of the variable of integration ω, we may move
it inside the bracketed integral and then interchange the order of integration:
W 1 =

2π
∞ ∞
−∞ −∞
F( jω)e jωt f (t) dt dω
Next we shift F( jω) outside the inner integral, causing that integral to be-
come F(− jω):

Marc Antoine Parseval-Deschenes was a rather obscure

before Fourier published his theorem.

|F( jω)| 2 dω
[54]
Equation [54] is a very useful expression known as Parseval’s theorem. This
theorem, along with Eq. [53], tells us that the energy associated with f (t)
can be obtained either from an integration over all time in the time domain
or by 1/(2π) times an integration over all (radian) frequency in the fre-
quency domain.
Parseval’s theorem also leads us to a greater understanding and interpre-
tation of the meaning of the Fourier transform. Consider a voltage v(t) with
Fourier transform F v ( jω) and 1 energy W 1 :

Figure 18.14 illustrates a typical plot of |F v ( jω)| 2 as a function of both ω and
f. If we divide the frequency scale up into vanishingly small increments d f ,
Eq. [55] shows us that the area of a differential slice under the |F v ( jω)| 2 curve,
having a width d f , is |F v ( jω)| 2 d f . This area is shown shaded. The sum of all
such areas, as f ranges from minus to plus infinity, is the total 1 energy con-
tained in v(t). Thus, |F v ( jω)| 2 is the (1 ) energy density or energy per unit
bandwidth (J/Hz) of v(t), and this energy density is always a real, even, non-
negative function of ω. By integrating |F v ( jω)| 2 over an appropriate fre-
quency interval, we are able to calculate that portion of the total energy lying
within the chosen interval. Note that the energy density is not a function of the
phase of F v ( jω), and thus there are an infinite number of time functions and
Fourier transforms that possess identical energy-density functions.

In general, we see that an ideal bandpass filter enables us to remove
energy from prescribed frequency ranges while still retaining the energy
contained in other frequency ranges. The Fourier transform helps us to
describe the filtering action quantitatively without actually evaluating v o (t),
although we will see later that the Fourier transform can also be used to
obtain the expression for v o (t) if we wish to do so.

FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIRS FOR SOME
• SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS
The Unit-Impulse Function
We now seek the Fourier transform of the unit impulse δ(t − t 0 ), a function
we introduced in Sec. 14.4. That is, we are interested in the spectral proper-
ties or frequency-domain description of this singularity function. If we use
the notation F{ } to symbolize “Fourier transform of {},” then
F {δ(t − t 0 )} =
∞
−∞
e − jωt δ(t − t 0 ) dt
From our earlier discussion of this type of integral, we have
F {δ(t − t 0 )} = e − jωt 0 = cos ωt 0 − j sin ωt 0SECTION 18.7 FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIRS FOR SOME SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS
This complex function of ω leads to the 1
energy-density function,
|F {δ(t − t 0 )}| 2 = cos 2 ωt 0 + sin 2 ωt 0 = 1
This remarkable result says that the (1 ) energy per unit bandwidth is unity
at all frequencies, and that the total energy in the unit impulse is infinitely
large. No wonder, then, that we must conclude that the unit impulse is
“impractical” in the sense that it cannot be generated in the laboratory. More-
over, even if one were available to us, it must appear distorted after being
subjected to the finite bandwidth of any practical laboratory instrument.
Since there is a unique one-to-one correspondence between a time func-
tion and its Fourier transform, we can say that the inverse Fourier transform
of e − jωt 0 is δ(t − t 0 ). Utilizing the symbol F −1 { } for the inverse transform,
we have
F −1 {e − jωt 0 } = δ(t − t 0 )
Thus, we now know that
1
2π
∞
−∞
e jωt e − jωt 0 dω = δ(t − t 0 )
even though we would fail in an attempt at the direct evaluation of this
improper integral. Symbolically, we may write
δ(t − t 0 ) ⇔ e − jωt 0
[56]
where ⇔ indicates that the two functions constitute a Fourier transform pair.
Continuing with our consideration of the unit-impulse function, let us
consider a Fourier transform in that form,
F( jω) = δ(ω − ω 0 )
which is a unit impulse in the frequency domain located at ω = ω 0 . Then
f (t) must be
f (t) = F −1 {F( jω)} =

e jωt δ(ω − ω 0 ) dω =

where we have used the sifting property of the unit impulse. Thus we may
now write
1 jω 0 t
⇔ δ(ω − ω 0 )
e
2π
or
e jω 0 t ⇔ 2πδ(ω − ω 0 )
[57]
Also, by a simple sign change we obtain
e − jω 0 t ⇔ 2πδ(ω + ω 0 )
[58]
Clearly, the time function is complex in both expressions [57] and [58], and
does not exist in the real world of the laboratory.
However, we know that
cos ω 0 t = 12 e jω 0 t + 12 e − jω 0 t

and it is easily seen from the definition of the Fourier transform that
F { f 1 (t)} + F { f 2 (t)} = F { f 1 (t) + f 2 (t)}
[59]
Therefore,

= πδ(ω − ω 0 ) + πδ(ω + ω 0 )
which indicates that the frequency-domain description of cos ω 0 t shows a
pair of impulses, located at ω = ±ω 0 . This should not be a great surprise,
for in our first discussion of complex frequency in Chap. 14, we noted that
a sinusoidal function of time was always represented by a pair of imaginary
frequencies located at s = ± jω 0 . We have, therefore,
cos ω 0 t ⇔ π[δ(ω + ω 0 ) + δ(ω − ω 0 )]
[60]
The Constant Forcing Function
To find the Fourier transform of a constant function of time, f (t) = K, our
first inclination might be to substitute this constant in the defining equation
for the Fourier transform and evaluate the resulting integral. If we did, we
would find ourselves with an indeterminate expression on our hands.
Fortunately, however, we have already solved this problem, for from
expression [58],
e − jω 0 t ⇔ 2πδ(ω + ω 0 )
We see that if we simply let ω 0 = 0, then the resulting transform pair is
1 ⇔ 2πδ(ω) [61]
K ⇔ 2πKδ(ω) [62]
from which it follows that
and our problem is solved. The frequency spectrum of a constant function
of time consists only of a component at ω = 0, which we knew all along.
The Signum Function
As another example, let us obtain the Fourier transform of a singularity
function known as the signum function, sgn(t), defined by
sgn(t) =
−1 t < 0
1 t > 0
[63]
or
sgn(t) = u(t) − u(−t)
Again, if we should try to substitute this time function in the defining equa-
tion for the Fourier transform, we would face an indeterminate expression
upon substitution of the limits of integration. This same problem will arise
every time we attempt to obtain the Fourier transform of a time function that
does not approach zero as |t| approaches infinity. Fortunately, we can avoid
this situation by using the Laplace transform, as it contains a built-in con-
vergence factor that cures many of the inconvenient ills associated with the
evaluation of certain Fourier transforms.SECTION 18.7 FOURIER TRANSFORM PAIRS FOR SOME SIMPLE TIME FUNCTIONS
767
Along those lines, the signum function under consideration can be writ-
ten as
sgn(t) = lim [e −at u(t) − e at u(−t)]
a→0
Notice that the expression within the brackets does approach zero as |t| gets
very large. Using the definition of the Fourier transform, we obtain

The real component is zero, since sgn(t) is an odd function of t. Thus,

The Unit-Step Function
As a final example in this section, let us look at the familiar unit-step func-
tion, u(t). Making use of our work on the signum function in the preceding
paragraphs, we represent the unit step by
u(t) =

THE FOURIER TRANSFORM OF A GENERAL
• PERIODIC TIME FUNCTION
In Sec. 18.5 we remarked that we would be able to show that periodic time
functions, as well as nonperiodic functions, possess Fourier transforms. Let
us now establish this fact on a rigorous basis. Consider a periodic time func-
tion f (t) with period T and Fourier series expansion, as outlined by
Eqs. [39], [40], and [41], repeated here for convenience:

and
ω 0 =
Bearing in mind that the Fourier transform of a sum is just the sum of the
transforms of the terms in the sum, and that c n is not a function of time, we
can write
F { f (t)} = F

After obtaining the transform of e jnω 0 t from expression [57], we have

[66]
This shows that f (t) has a discrete spectrum consisting of impulses located
at points on the ω axis given by ω = nω 0 , n = . . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, . . . . The
strength of each impulse is 2π times the value of the corresponding Fourier
coefficient appearing in the complex form of the Fourier series expansion
for f (t).
As a check on our work, let us see whether the inverse Fourier transform
of the right side of expression [66] is once again f (t). This inverse trans-
form can be written as

CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
which is exactly the same as Eq. [39], the complex Fourier series expan-
sion for f (t). The question marks in the preceding equations can now be
removed, and the existence of the Fourier transform for a periodic time
function is established. This should come as no great surprise, however.
In the last section we evaluated the Fourier transform of a cosine func-
tion, which is certainly periodic, although we made no direct reference
to its periodicity. However, we did use a backhanded approach in getting
the transform. But now we have a mathematical tool by which the
transform can be obtained more directly. To demonstrate this procedure,
consider f (t) = cos ω 0 t once more. First we evaluate the Fourier
coefficients c n :

This expression has values that are nonzero only when n = ±1, and it fol-
lows, therefore, that the entire summation reduces to

which is precisely the expression that we obtained before. What a relief!

18.9 THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND RESPONSE
• IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
In Sec. 15.5, the problem of determining the output of a physical system
in terms of the input and the impulse response was solved by using the
convolution integral and initially working in the time domain. The input,
the output, and the impulse response are all time functions. Subsequently,
we found that it was often more convenient to perform such operations in
the frequency domain, as the Laplace transform of the convolution of two
functions is simply the product of each function in the frequency domain.
Along the same lines, we find the same is true when working with Fourier
transforms.
To do this we examine the Fourier transform of the system output. As-
suming arbitrarily that the input and output are voltages, we apply the basicSECTION 18.9 THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND RESPONSE IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
definition of the Fourier transform and express the output by the convolution
integral:
F {v 0 (t)} = F 0 ( jω) =
∞
−∞
∞
e − jωt
−∞
v i (t − z)h(z) dz dt
where we again assume no initial energy storage. At first glance this
expression may seem rather formidable, but it can be reduced to a result that
is surprisingly simple. We may move the exponential term inside the inner
integral because it does not contain the variable of integration z. Next we
reverse the order of integration, obtaining
F 0 ( jω) =
∞ ∞
−∞ −∞
e − jωt v i (t − z)h(z) dt dz
Since it is not a function of t, we can extract h(z) from the inner integral
and simplify the integration with respect to t by a change of variable,
t − z = x :
F 0 ( jω) =

∞
−∞

h(z)
∞
−∞
e − jωz h(z)
e − jω(x+z) v i (x) dx dz
∞
−∞
e − jωx v i (x) dx dz
But now the sun is starting to break through, for the inner integral is merely
the Fourier transform of v i (t). Furthermore, it contains no z terms and can
be treated as a constant in any integration involving z. Thus, we can move
this transform, F i ( jω), completely outside all the integral signs:
F 0 ( jω) = F i ( jω)
∞
−∞
e − jωz h(z) dz
Finally, the remaining integral exhibits our old friend once more, another
Fourier transform! This one is the Fourier transform of the impulse re-
sponse, which we will designate by the notation H( jω). Therefore, all our
work has boiled down to the simple result:
F 0 ( jω) = F i ( jω)H( jω) = F i ( jω)F {h(t)}
This is another important result: it defines the system function H( jω) as the
ratio of the Fourier transform of the response function to the Fourier trans-
form of the forcing function. Moreover, the system function and the impulse
response constitute a Fourier transform pair:
h(t) ⇔ H( jω)
[67]
The development in the preceding paragraph also serves to prove the
general statement that the Fourier transform of the convolution of two time
functions is the product of their Fourier transforms,
F { f (t) ∗ g(t)} = F f ( jω)F g ( jω)
[68]
771772
To recapitulate, if we know the Fourier transforms of the
forcing function and the impulse response, then the
Fourier transform of the response function can be ob-
tained as their product. The result is a description of the
response function in the frequency domain; the time-
domain description of the response function is obtained
by simply taking the inverse Fourier transform. Thus we
see that the process of convolution in the time domain
is equivalent to the relatively simple operation of multi-
plication in the frequency domain.
CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
The foregoing comments might make us wonder once again why we would
ever choose to work in the time domain at all, but we must always remember
that we seldom get something for nothing. A poet once said, “Our sincerest
laughter/with some pain is fraught.” 2 The pain herein is the occasional dif-
ficulty in obtaining the inverse Fourier transform of a response function, for
reasons of mathematical complexity. On the other hand, a simple desktop
computer can convolve two time functions with magnificent celerity. For
that matter, it can also obtain an FFT (fast Fourier transform) quite rapidly.
Consequently there is no clear-cut advantage between working in the time
domain and in the frequency domain. A decision must be made each time a
new problem arises; it should be based on the information available and on
the computational facilities at hand.
Consider a forcing function of the form
v i (t) = u(t) − u(t − 1)
and a unit-impulse response defined by
h(t) = 2e −t u(t)
We first obtain the corresponding Fourier transforms. The forcing function
is the difference between two unit-step functions. These two functions are
identical, except that one is initiated 1 s after the other. We will evaluate the
response due to u(t); the response due to u(t − 1) is the same, but delayed
in time by 1 s. The difference between these two partial responses will be
the total response due to v i (t).
The Fourier transform of u(t) was obtained in Sec. 18.7:
F {u(t)} = πδ(ω) +

The system function is obtained by taking the Fourier transform of h(t),
listed in Table 18.2,
F {h(t)} = H( jω) = F {2e −t u(t)} =

Using the sifting property of the unit impulse, the inverse transform of the
first term is just a constant equal to unity. Thus,
v o1 (t) = 1 + F −1
2
jω(1 + jω)
The second term contains a product of terms in the denominator, each of
the form (α + jω), and its inverse transform is found most easily by making
use of the partial-fraction expansion that we developed in Sec. 14.5. Let us
(2) P. B. Shelley, “To a Skylark,” 1821.SECTION 18.9 THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND RESPONSE IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
select a technique for obtaining a partial-fraction expansion that has one big
advantage—it always works, although faster methods are usually available
for most situations. We assign an unknown quantity in the numerator of each
fraction, here two in number,

we let jω = 1:

and then let jω = −2:

v o2 (t) = 2(1 − e −(t−1) )u(t − 1)

CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
COMPUTER-AIDED ANALYSIS
The material presented in this chapter forms the foundation for many
advanced fields of study, including signal processing, communica-
tions, and controls. We are only able to introduce some of the more
fundamental concepts within the context of an introductory circuits
text, but even at this point some of the power of Fourier-based analy-
sis can be brought to bear. As a first example, consider the op amp
circuit of Fig. 18.15, constructed in PSpice using a μA741 opera-
tional amplifier.
■ FIGURE 18.15 An inverting amplifier circuit with a voltage gain of −10, driven by a
sinusoidal input operating at 100 Hz.
The circuit has a voltage gain of −10, and so we would expect a
sinusoidal output of 10 V amplitude. This is indeed what we obtain
from a transient analysis of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 18.16.
■ FIGURE 18.16 Simulated output voltage of the amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 18.15.SECTION 18.9 THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND RESPONSE IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
PSpice allows us to determine the frequency spectrum of the output
voltage through what is known as a fast Fourier transform (FFT), a
discrete-time approximation to the exact Fourier transform of the sig-
nal. From within Probe, we select Fourier under the Trace menu; the
result is the plot shown in Fig. 18.17. As expected, the line spectrum for
the output voltage of this amplifier circuit consists of a single feature at
a frequency of 100 Hz.
■ FIGURE 18.17 Discrete approximation to the Fourier transform of Fig. 18.16.
As the input voltage magnitude is increased, the output of the ampli-
fier approaches the saturation condition determined by the positive and
negative dc supply voltages (±15 V in this example). This behavior is
evident in the simulation result of Fig. 18.18, which corresponds to an
input voltage magnitude of 1.8 V. A key feature of interest is that the
output voltage waveform is no longer a pure sinusoid. As a result, we
expect nonzero values at harmonic frequencies to appear in the

fect of reaching saturation in the amplifier circuit is a distortion of the
signal; if connected to a speaker, we do not hear a “clean” 100 Hz
waveform. Instead, we now hear a superposition of waveforms which
include not only the 100 Hz fundamental frequency, but significant har-
monic components at 300 and 500 Hz as well. Further distortion of the
waveform would increase the amount of energy in harmonic frequen-
cies, so that contributions from higher-frequency harmonics would
become more significant. This is evident in the simulation results of
Fig. 18.20a and b, which show the output voltage in the time and
frequency domains, respectively.

THE PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
• SYSTEM FUNCTION
In this section we will try to connect several aspects of the Fourier trans-
form with work we completed in earlier chapters.
Given a general linear two-port network N without any initial energy
storage, we assume sinusoidal forcing and response functions, arbitrarily
taken to be voltages, as shown in Fig. 18.21. We let the input voltage be
simply A cos(ω x t + θ), and the output can be described in general terms as
v o (t) = B cos(ω x t + φ), where the amplitude B and phase angle φ are
functions of ω x . In phasor form, we can write the forcing and response func-
tions as V i = Ae jθ and V o = Be jφ . The ratio of the phasor response to the
phasor forcing function is a complex number that is a function of ω x :
V o
B
= G(ω x ) = e j (φ−θ)
V i

where B/A is the amplitude of G and φ − θ is its phase angle. This transfer
function G(ω x ) could be obtained in the laboratory by varying ω x over a
large range of values and measuring the amplitude B/A and phase φ − θ
for each value of ω x . If we then plotted each of these parameters as a func-
tion of frequency, the resultant pair of curves would completely describe the
transfer function.

functions of ω x .
Now let us hold these comments in the backs of our minds for a moment
as we consider a slightly different aspect of the same analysis problem.
For the circuit with sinusoidal input and output shown in Fig. 18.21,
what is the system function H( jω)? To answer this question, we begin with
the definition of H( jω) as the ratio of the Fourier transforms of the output
and the input. Both of these time functions involve the functional form

H( jω) at ω = ω x gives

Since there is nothing special about the x subscript, we conclude that the
system function and the transfer function are identical:
H( jω) = G(ω)
[70]
The fact that one argument is ω while the other is indicated by jω is imma-
terial and arbitrary; the j merely makes possible a more direct comparison
between the Fourier and Laplace transforms.
Equation [70] represents a direct connection between Fourier transform
techniques and sinusoidal steady-state analysis. Our previous work on
steady-state sinusoidal analysis using phasors was but a special case of the
more general techniques of Fourier transform analysis. It was ‘‘special’’ in
the sense that the inputs and outputs were sinusoids, whereas the use of
Fourier transforms and system functions enables us to handle nonsinusoidal
forcing functions and responses.
Thus, to find the system function H( jω) for a network, all we need to do
is to determine the corresponding sinusoidal transfer function as a function
of ω (or jω).779
SECTION 18.10 THE PHYSICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SYSTEM FUNCTION
EXAMPLE 18.8
Find the voltage across the inductor of the circuit shown in
Fig. 18.22a when the input voltage is a simple exponentially decay-
ing pulse, as indicated.
We need the system function; but it is not necessary to apply an
impulse, find the impulse response, and then determine its inverse
transform. Instead we use Eq. [70] to obtain the system function H( jω)
by assuming that the input and output voltages are both sinusoids
described by their corresponding phasors, as shown in Fig. 18.22b.
Using voltage division, we have
H( jω) =

F {v i (t)} =

Image Processing
Although a great deal of progress has been made toward
developing a complete understanding of the function of
muscle, there remain many open questions. A great deal
of research in this field has been carried out using verte-
brate skeletal muscle, in particular the sartorius or leg
muscle of the frog (Fig. 18.24).
■ FIGURE 18.24 Close-up of a frog against an orange background.

Of the many analytical techniques scientists use, one
of the most common is electron microscopy. Figure 18.25
shows an electron micrograph of frog sartorius muscle
tissue, sectioned in such a fashion as to highlight the reg-
ular arrangement of myosin, a filamentary type of con-
tractile protein. Of interest to structural biologists are the
periodicity and disorder of these proteins over a large
area of muscle tissue. In order to develop a model for
these characteristics, a numerical approach is preferable,
where the analysis of such images can be automated. As
can be seen in the figure, however, the image produced
by the electron microscope can be contaminated by a
high level of background noise, making automated iden-
tification of the myosin filaments prone to error.
Introduced with the intent of ultimately assisting us in
the analysis of time-varying linear circuits, the Fourier-
based techniques of this chapter are in fact very powerful
general methods which find application in many other
situations. Among these, the field of image processing
makes frequent use of Fourier techniques, especially
through the fast Fourier transform and related numerical
methods. The image of Fig. 18.25 can be described by
a spatial function f (x, y) where f (x, y) = 0 corresponds
to white, f (x, y) = 1 corresponds to red, and (x, y)
denotes a pixel location in the image. Defining a filter
function h(x, y) that has the appearance of Fig. 18.26a,
the convolution operation
g(x, y) = f (x, y) ∗ h(x, y)

results in the image of Fig. 18.26b in which the
myosin filaments (viewed on end) are more clearly
identifiable.
In practice, this image processing is performed in the
frequency domain, where the FFT of both f and h are cal-
culated, and the resulting matrices multiplied together.
Epilogue
Returning again to Eq. [70], the identity between the system function H( jω)
and the sinusoidal steady-state transfer function G(ω), we may now consider
the system function as the ratio of the output phasor to the input phasor. Sup-
pose that we hold the input-phasor amplitude at unity and the phase angle at
zero. Then the output phasor is H( jω). Under these conditions, if we record
the output amplitude and phase as functions of ω, for all ω, we have recorded
the system function H( jω) as a function of ω, for all ω. We thus have exam-
ined the system response under the condition that an infinite number of sinu-
soids, all with unity amplitude and zero phase, were successively applied at
the input. Now suppose that our input is a single unit impulse, and look at the(a)
spatial frequencies. The convolution of f with h results in
a reinforcement of the hexagonal pattern within the orig-
inal image, and the removal of noise pixels (which do
not possess hexagonal symmetry). This can be under-
stood qualitatively if we model a horizontal row of Fig.
18.25 as a sinusoidal function f (x) = cos ω 0 t , which
has the Fourier transform shown in Fig. 18.27a—a
matched pair of impulse functions separated by 2ω 0 . If
we convolve this function with a filter function
h(x) = cos ω 1 t , the Fourier transform of which is de-
picted in Fig. 18.27b, we get zero if ω 1 = ω 0 ; the fre-
quencies (periodicities) of the two functions do not
match. If, instead, we choose a filter function with the
same frequency as f (x), the convolution has a nonzero
value at ω = ±ω 0 .

An inverse FFT operation then produces the filtered im-
age of Fig. 18.26b. Why does this convolution equate to
a filtering operation? The myosin filament arrangement
possesses hexagonal symmetry, as does the filter func-
tion h(x , y)—in a sense, both the myosin filament
arrangement and the filter function possess the same

impulse response h(t). Is the information we examine really any different
from what we just obtained? The Fourier transform of the unit impulse is a
constant equal to unity, indicating that all frequency components are present,
all with the same magnitude, and all with zero phase. Our system response is
the sum of the responses to all these components. The result might be viewed
at the output on a cathode-ray oscilloscope. It is evident that the system func-
tion and the impulse-response function contain equivalent information re-
garding the response of the system.
We therefore have two different methods of describing the response of a
system to a general forcing function; one is a time-domain description, and
the other a frequency-domain description. Working in the time domain, we782
CHAPTER 18 FOURIER CIRCUIT ANALYSIS
convolve the forcing function with the impulse response of the system to
obtain the response function. As we saw when we first considered convolu-
tion, this procedure may be interpreted by thinking of the input as a contin-
uum of impulses of different strengths and times of application; the output
which results is a continuum of impulse responses.
In the frequency domain, however, we determine the response by
multiplying the Fourier transform of the forcing function by the system
function. In this case we interpret the transform of the forcing function as a
frequency spectrum, or a continuum of sinusoids. Multiplying this by the
system function, we obtain the response function, also as a continuum of
sinusoids.
SUMMARY AND REVIEW
Whether we choose to think of the output as a continuum of impulse
responses or as a continuum of sinusoidal responses, the linearity of the net-
work and the superposition principle enable us to determine the total output
as a time function by summing over all frequencies (the inverse Fourier
transform), or as a frequency function by summing over all time (the
Fourier transform).
Unfortunately, both of these techniques have some difficulties or limi-
tations associated with their use. In using convolution, the integral itself
can often be rather difficult to evaluate when complicated forcing func-
tions or impulse response functions are present. Furthermore, from the
experimental point of view, we cannot really measure the impulse re-
sponse of a system because we cannot actually generate an impulse. Even
if we approximated the impulse by a narrow high-amplitude pulse, we
would probably drive our system into saturation and out of its linear oper-
ating range.
With regard to the frequency domain, we encounter one absolute limita-
tion in that we may easily hypothesize forcing functions that we would like
to apply theoretically that do not possess Fourier transforms. Moreover, if
we wish to find the time-domain description of the response function, we
must evaluate an inverse Fourier transform, and some of these inversions
can be extremely difficult.
Finally, neither of these techniques offers a very convenient method
of handling initial conditions. For this, the Laplace transform is clearly
superior.
The greatest benefits derived from the use of the Fourier transform arise
through the abundance of useful information it provides about the spectral
properties of a signal, particularly the energy or power per unit bandwidth.
Some of this information is also easily obtained through the Laplace trans-
form; we must leave a detailed discussion of the relative merits of each to
more advanced signals and systems courses.
So, why has this all been withheld until now? The best answer is proba-
bly that these powerful techniques can overcomplicate the solution of
simple problems and tend to obscure the physical interpretation of the per-
formance of the simpler networks. For example, if we are interested only in
the forced response, then there is little point in using the Laplace transformEXERCISES
and obtaining both the forced and natural response after laboring through a
difficult inverse transform operation.
Well, we could go on, but all good things must come to an end. Best of
luck to you in your future studies.

The harmonic frequencies of a sinusoid having the fundamental
frequency ω 0 are nω 0 , where n is an integer. (Examples 18.1, 18.2)
The Fourier theorem states that provided a function f (t) satisfies
certain key properties, it may be represented by the infinite series

A function f (t) possesses even symmetry if f (t) = f (−t).
A function f (t) possesses odd symmetry if f (t) = − f (−t).
A function f (t) possesses half-wave symmetry if f (t) = − f (t − 12 T ).
The Fourier series of an even function is composed of only a constant
and cosine functions.
The Fourier series of an odd function is composed of only sine functions.
The Fourier series of any function possessing half-wave symmetry
contains only odd harmonics.
The Fourier series of a function may also be expressed in complex

f (t) = (1/2π) −∞ e F( jω) dω. (Examples 18.5, 18.6, 18.7)

what is done using Laplace transforms. (Example 18.8)

AN INTRODUCTION TO
NETWORK TOPOLOGY
After working many circuits problems, it slowly becomes evident that many
of the circuits we see have quite a bit in common, at least in terms of the
arrangement of components. From this realization, it is possible to create a
more abstract view of circuits which we call network topology, a subject we
introduce in this appendix.
A1.1
•
TREES AND GENERAL NODAL ANALYSIS
We now plan to generalize the method of nodal analysis that we have come
to know and love. Since nodal analysis is applicable to any network, we
cannot promise that we will be able to solve a wider class of circuit prob-
lems. We can, however, look forward to being able to select a general nodal
analysis method for any particular problem that may result in fewer equa-
tions and less work.
We must first extend our list of definitions relating to network topology.
We begin by defining topology itself as a branch of geometry which is con-
cerned with those properties of a geometrical figure which are unchanged
when the figure is twisted, bent, folded, stretched, squeezed, or tied in knots,
with the provision that no parts of the figure are to be cut apart or to be
joined together. A sphere and a tetrahedron are topologically identical, as
are a square and a circle. In terms of electric circuits, then, we are not now
concerned with the particular types of elements appearing in the circuit, but
only with the way in which branches and nodes are arranged. As a matter of
fact, we usually suppress the nature of the elements and simplify the draw-
ing of the circuit by showing the elements as lines. The resultant drawing is
called a linear graph, or simply a graph. A circuit and its graph are shown in
Fig. A1.1. Note that all nodes are identified by heavy dots in the graph.
Since the topological properties of the circuit or its graph are unchanged
when it is distorted, the three graphs shown in Fig. A1.2 are all topologi-
cally identical with the circuit and graph of Fig. A1.1.
Topological terms that we already know and have been using correctly
are
Node: A point at which two or more elements have a common
connection.
Path: A set of elements that may be traversed in order without passing
through the same node twice.
Branch: A single path, containing one simple element, which connects
one node to any other node.

Loop: A closed path.
Mesh: A loop which does not contain any other loops within it.
Planar circuit: A circuit which may be drawn on a plane surface in
such a way that no branch passes over or under any other branch.
Nonplanar circuit: Any circuit which is not planar.
The graphs of Fig. A1.2 each contain 12 branches and 7 nodes.
Three new properties of a linear graph must now be defined—a tree, a
cotree, and a link. We define a tree as any set of branches which does not
contain any loops and yet connects every node to every other node, not nec-
essarily directly. There are usually a number of different trees which may
be drawn for a network, and the number increases rapidly as the complex-
ity of the network increases. The simple graph shown in Fig. A1.3a has
eight possible trees, four of which are shown by heavy lines in Fig. A1.3b,
c, d, and e.

■ FIGURE A1.4 (a) A linear graph. (b) A possible
tree for this graph. (c , d ) These sets of branches do
not satisfy the definition of a tree.
In Fig. A1.4a a more complex graph is shown. Figure A1.4b shows one
possible tree, and Fig. A1.4c and d show sets of branches which are not
trees because neither set satisfies the definition.
After a tree has been specified, those branches that are not part of the
tree form the cotree, or complement of the tree. The lightly drawn branches
in Fig. A1.3b to e show the cotrees that correspond to the heavier trees.
Once we understand the construction of a tree and its cotree, the concept
of the link is very simple, for a link is any branch belonging to the cotree. It
is evident that any particular branch may or may not be a link, depending on
the particular tree which is selected.
The number of links in a graph may easily be related to the number of
branches and nodes. If the graph has N nodes, then exactly (N − 1)
branches are required to construct a tree because the first branch chosen
connects two nodes and each additional branch includes one more node.APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
Thus, given B branches, the number of links L must be
L = B − (N − 1)
or
L = B − N + 1
[1]
There are L branches in the cotree and (N − 1) branches in the tree.
In any of the graphs shown in Fig. A1.3, we note that 3 = 5 − 3 + 1, and
in the graph of Fig. A1.4b, 6 = 10 − 5 + 1. A network may be in several
disconnected parts, and Eq. [1] may be made more general by replacing +1
with +S, where S is the number of separate parts. However, it is also possi-
ble to connect two separate parts by a single conductor, thus causing two
nodes to form one node; no current can flow through this single conductor.
This process may be used to join any number of separate parts, and thus we
will not suffer any loss of generality if we restrict our attention to circuits
for which S = 1.
We are now ready to discuss a method by which we may write a set of
nodal equations that are independent and sufficient. The method will enable
us to obtain many different sets of equations for the same network, and all
the sets will be valid. However, the method does not provide us with every
possible set of equations. Let us first describe the procedure, illustrate it by
three examples, and then point out the reason that the equations are inde-
pendent and sufficient.
Given a network, we should:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Draw a graph and then identify a tree.
Place all voltage sources in the tree.
Place all current sources in the cotree.
Place all control-voltage branches for voltage-controlled dependent
sources in the tree, if possible.
5. Place all control-current branches for current-controlled dependent
sources in the cotree, if possible.
These last four steps effectively associate voltages with the tree and currents
with the cotree.
We now assign a voltage variable (with its plus-minus pair) across each
of the (N − 1) branches in the tree. A branch containing a voltage source
(dependent or independent) should be assigned that source voltage, and a
branch containing a controlling voltage should be assigned that controlling
voltage. The number of new variables that we have introduced is therefore
equal to the number of branches in the tree (N − 1), reduced by the number
of voltage sources in the tree, and reduced also by the number of control
voltages we were able to locate in the tree. In Example A1.3, we will find
that the number of new variables required may be zero.
Having a set of variables, we now need to write a set of equations that
are sufficient to determine these variables. The equations are obtained
through the application of KCL. Voltage sources are handled in the same
way that they were in our earlier attack on nodal analysis; each voltage
793794
APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
source and the two nodes at its terminals constitute a supernode or a part of
a supernode. Kirchhoff’s current law is then applied at all but one of the re-
maining nodes and supernodes. We set the sum of the currents leaving the
node in all of the branches connected to it equal to zero. Each current is ex-
pressed in terms of the voltage variables we just assigned. One node may be
ignored, just as was the case earlier for the reference node. Finally, in case
there are current-controlled dependent sources, we must write an equation
for each control current that relates it to the voltage variables; this also is no
different from the procedure used before with nodal analysis.
Let us try out this process on the circuit shown in Fig. A1.5a. It contains
four nodes and five branches, and its graph is shown in Fig. A1.5b.

graph of the given circuit. (c ) The voltage source and the control voltage are placed in
the tree, while the current source goes in the cotree. (d )The tree is completed and a
voltage is assigned across each tree branch.
In accordance with steps 2 and 3 of the tree-drawing procedure, we
place the voltage source in the tree and the current source in the cotree.
Following step 4, we see that the v x branch may also be placed in the
tree, since it does not form any loop which would violate the definition
of a tree. We have now arrived at the two tree branches and the single
link shown in Fig. A1.5c, and we see that we do not yet have a tree,
since the right node is not connected to the others by a path through
tree branches. The only possible way to complete the tree is shown in
Fig. A1.5d. The 100 V source voltage, the control voltage v x , and a
new voltage variable v 1 are next assigned to the three tree branches as
shown.
We therefore have two unknowns, v x and v 1 , and we need to obtain
two equations in terms of them. There are four nodes, but the presenceAPPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
795
of the voltage source causes two of them to form a single supernode.
Kirchhoff’s current law may be applied at any two of the three
remaining nodes or supernodes. Let’s attack the right node first. The
current leaving to the left is −v 1 /15, while that leaving downward is
−v x /14. Thus, our first equation is
−
−v x
v 1
+
= 0

14
The central node at the top looks easier than the supernode, and so we
set the sum of the current to the left (−v x /8), the current to the right
(v 1 /15), and the downward current through the 4- resistor equal to
zero. This latter current is given by the voltage across the resistor
divided by 4 , but there is no voltage labeled on that link. However,
when a tree is constructed according to the definition, there is a path
through it from any node to any other node. Then, since every branch
in the tree is assigned a voltage, we may express the voltage across any
link in terms of the tree-branch voltages. This downward current is
therefore (−v x + 100)/4, and we have the second equation,

We draw a tree so that both voltage sources and both control voltages
appear as tree-branch voltages and, hence, as assigned variables. As it
happens, these four branches constitute a tree, Fig. A1.6b, and tree-
branch voltages v x , 1, v y , and 4v y are chosen, as shown.
(Continued on next page)796
APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
Both voltage sources define supernodes, and we apply KCL twice,
once to the top node,
2v x + 1(v x − v y − 4v y ) = 2
and once to the supernode consisting of the right node, the bottom
node, and the dependent voltage source,
1v y + 2(v y − 1) + 1(4v y + v y − v x ) = 2v x
Instead of the four equations we would expect using previously studied
techniques, we have only two, and we find easily that v x = 26
9 V and
v y = 43 V.

KCL equation. Selecting the lower left node, we have

and it follows that v x = − 32
3 V. In spite of the apparent complexity of
this circuit, the use of general nodal analysis has led to an easy solution.
Employing mesh currents or node-to-reference voltages would require
more equations and more effort.

We will discuss the problem of finding the best analysis scheme in the
following section.
If we needed to know some other voltage, current, or power in the pre-
vious example, one additional step would give the answer. For example, the
power provided by the 3 A source is
3 −30 −
32

= −122 W
Let us conclude by discussing the sufficiency of the assumed set of tree-
branch voltages and the independence of the nodal equations. If these tree-
branch voltages are sufficient, then the voltage of every branch in either the
tree or the cotree must be obtainable from a knowledge of the values of all
the tree-branch voltages. This is certainly true for those branches in the tree.
For the links we know that each link extends between two nodes, and, by
definition, the tree must also connect those two nodes. Hence, every link
voltage may also be established in terms of the tree-branch voltages.
Once the voltage across every branch in the circuit is known, then all
the currents may be found by using either the given value of the current
if the branch consists of a current source, by using Ohm’s law if it is a
resistive branch, or by using KCL and these current values if the branch
happens to be a voltage source. Thus, all the voltages and currents are
determined and sufficiency is demonstrated.APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
To demonstrate independency, let us satisfy ourselves by assuming the
situation where the only sources in the network are independent current
sources. As we have noticed earlier, independent voltage sources in the cir-
cuit result in fewer equations, while dependent sources usually necessitate a
greater number of equations. With independent current sources only, there
will then be precisely (N − 1) nodal equations written in terms of (N − 1)
tree-branch voltages. To show that these (N − 1) equations are independ-
ent, visualize the application of KCL to the (N − 1) different nodes. Each
time we write the KCL equation, there is a new tree branch involved—the
one which connects that node to the remainder of the tree. Since that circuit
element has not appeared in any previous equation, we must obtain an in-
dependent equation. This is true for each of the (N − 1) nodes in turn, and
hence we have (N − 1) independent equations.

LINKS AND LOOP ANALYSIS
Now we will consider the use of a tree to obtain a suitable set of loop
equations. In some respects this is the dual of the method of writing nodal
equations. Again it should be pointed out that, although we are able to guar-
antee that any set of equations we write will be both sufficient and inde-
pendent, we should not expect that the method will lead directly to every
possible set of equations.
We again begin by constructing a tree, and we use the same set of rules
as we did for general nodal analysis. The objective for either nodal or loop
analysis is to place voltages in the tree and currents in the cotree; this is a
mandatory rule for sources and a desirable rule for controlling quantities.
Now, however, instead of assigning a voltage to each branch in the tree,
we assign a current (including reference arrow, of course) to each element
in the cotree or to each link. If there were 10 links, we would assign exactly
10 link currents. Any link that contains a current source is assigned that
source current as the link current. Note that each link current may also be
797APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
thought of as a loop current, for the link must extend between two specific
nodes, and there must also be a path between those same two nodes through
the tree. Thus, with each link there is associated a single specific loop that
includes that one link and a unique path through the tree. It is evident that
the assigned current may be thought of either as a loop current or as a link
current. The link connotation is most helpful at the time the currents are be-
ing defined, for one must be established for each link; the loop interpreta-
tion is more convenient at equation-writing time, because we will apply
KVL around each loop.
Let us try out this process of defining link currents by considering the
circuit shown in Fig. A1.9a. The tree selected is one of several that might be
constructed for which the voltage source is in a tree branch and the current
source is in a link. Let us first consider the link containing the current source.
The loop associated with this link is the left-hand mesh, and so we show our
link current flowing about the perimeter of this mesh (Fig. A1.9b). An obvi-
ous choice for the symbol for this link current is ‘‘7 A.’’ Remember that no
other current can flow through this particular link, and thus its value must be
exactly the strength of the current source.

■ FIGURE A1.9 (a) A simple circuit. (b) A tree is chosen such that the

We next turn our attention to the 3 resistor link. The loop associated
with it is the upper right-hand mesh, and this loop (or mesh) current is
defined as i A and also shown in Fig. A1.9b. The last link is the lower 1
resistor, and the only path between its terminals through the tree is around
the perimeter of the circuit. That link current is called i B , and the arrow
indicating its path and reference direction appears in Fig. A1.9b. It is not a
mesh current.
Note that each link has only one current present in it, but a tree branch
may have any number from 1 to the total number of link currents assigned.
The use of long, almost closed, arrows to indicate the loops helps to indicate
which loop currents flow through which tree branch and what their refer-
ence directions are.
A KVL equation must now be written around each of these loops. The
variables used are the assigned link currents. Since the voltage across a cur-
rent source cannot be expressed in terms of the source current, and since we
have already used the value of the source current as the link current, we dis-
card any loop containing a current source.APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY
799
EXAMPLE A1.4
For the example of Fig. A1.9, find the values of i A and i B .
We first traverse the i A loop, proceeding clockwise from its lower left
corner. The current going our way in the 1 resistor is (i A − 7), in the
2 element it is (i A + i B ), and in the link it is simply i B . Thus
1(i A − 7) + 2(i A + i B ) + 3i A = 0
For the i B link, clockwise travel from the lower left corner leads to
−7 + 2(i A + i B ) + 1i B = 0
Traversal of the loop defined by the 7 A link is not required. Solving,
we have i A = 0.5 A, i B = 2 A, once again. The solution has been
achieved with one less equation than before!

This circuit contains six nodes, and its tree therefore must have five
branches. Since there are eight elements in the network, there are three
links in the cotree. If we place the three voltage sources in the tree and
the two current sources and the current control in the cotree, we are led
to the tree shown in Fig. A1.10b. The source current of 4 A defines a

loop as shown in Fig. A1.10c. The dependent source establishes the
loop current 1.5i 1 around the right mesh, and the control current i 1
gives us the remaining loop current about the perimeter of the circuit.
Note that all three currents flow through the 4 resistor.
We have only one unknown quantity, i 1 , and after discarding the
loops defined by the two current sources, we apply KVL around the
outside of the circuit:
−30 + 5(−i 1 ) + 19 + 2(−i 1 − 4) + 4(−i 1 − 4 + 1.5i 1 ) − 25 = 0
Besides the three voltage sources, there are three resistors in this loop.
The 5 resistor has one loop current in it, since it is also a link; the
2 resistor contains two loop currents; and the 4 resistor has three.
A carefully drawn set of loop currents is a necessity if errors in
skipping currents, utilizing extra ones, or erring in choosing the correct
direction are to be avoided. The foregoing equation is guaranteed,
however, and it leads to i 1 = −12 A.

How may we demonstrate sufficiency? Let us visualize a tree. It con-
tains no loops and therefore contains at least two nodes to each of which
only one tree branch is connected. The current in each of these two branches
is easily found from the known link currents by applying KCL. If there are
other nodes at which only one tree branch is connected, these tree-branch
currents may also be immediately obtained. In the tree shown in Fig. A1.11,
we thus have found the currents in branches a, b, c, and d. Now we move
along the branches of the tree, finding the currents in tree branches e and f;
the process may be continued until all the branch currents are determined.
The link currents are therefore sufficient to determine all branch currents. It
is helpful to look at the situation where an incorrect ‘‘tree’’ has been drawn
which contains a loop. Even if all the link currents were zero, a current
might still circulate about this ‘‘tree loop.’’ Hence, the link currents could
not determine this current, and they would not represent a sufficient set.
Such a ‘‘tree’’ is by definition impossible.
To demonstrate independence, let us satisfy ourselves by assuming the
situation where the only sources in the network are independent voltage
sources. As we have noticed earlier, independent current sources in the cir-
cuit result in fewer equations, while dependent sources usually necessitate a
greater number of equations. If only independent voltage sources are pres-
ent, there will then be precisely (B − N + 1) loop equations written in
terms of the (B − N + 1) link currents. To show that these (B − N + 1)
loop equations are independent, it is necessary only to point out that each
represents the application of KVL around a loop which contains one link
not appearing in any other equation. We might visualize a different resis-
tance R 1 , R 2 , . . . , R B−N +1 in each of these links, and it is then apparent that
one equation can never be obtained from the others, since each contains one
coefficient not appearing in any other equation.
Hence, the link currents are sufficient to enable a complete solution to be
obtained, and the set of loop equations which we use to find the link currents
is a set of independent equations.APPENDIX 1 AN INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TOPOLOGY

Having looked at both general nodal analysis and loop analysis, we
should now consider the advantages and disadvantages of each method so
that an intelligent choice of a plan of attack can be made on a given analy-
sis problem.
The nodal method in general requires (N − 1) equations, but this num-
ber is reduced by 1 for each independent or dependent voltage source in a
tree branch, and increased by 1 for each dependent source that is voltage-
controlled by a link voltage, or current-controlled.
The loop method basically involves (B − N + 1) equations. However,
each independent or dependent current source in a link reduces this number
by 1, while each dependent source that is current-controlled by a tree-
branch current, or is voltage-controlled, increases the number by 1.
As a grand finale for this discussion, let us inspect the T-equivalent
circuit model for a transistor shown in Fig. A1.12, to which is connected a
sinusoidal source, 4 sin 1000t mV, and a 10 k load.
EXAMPLE A1.6
Find the input (emitter) current i e and the load voltage v L in the
circuit of Fig. A1.12, assuming typical values for the emitter
resistance r e = 50 ; the base resistance r b = 500 ; the collector
resistance r c = 20 k ; and the common-base forward-current-
transfer ratio α = 0.99.

■ FIGURE A1.12 A sinusoidal voltage source and a 10 k load are
connected to the T-equivalent circuit of a transistor. The common connection
between the input and output is at the base terminal of the transistor, and the
arrangement is called the common-base configuration.
Although the details are requested in the practice problems that follow,
we should see readily that the analysis of this circuit might be
accomplished by drawing trees requiring three general nodal equations
(N − 1 − 1 + 1) or two loop equations (B − N + 1 − 1). We might
also note that three equations are required in terms of node-to-reference
voltages, as are three mesh equations.
No matter which method we choose, these results are obtained for
this specific circuit:
i e = 18.42 sin 1000t
v L = 122.6 sin 1000t

and we therefore find that this transistor circuit provides a voltage gain
(v L /v s ) of 30.6, a current gain (v L /10,000i e ) of 0.666, and a power
gain equal to the product 30.6(0.666) = 20.4. Higher gains could be
secured by operating this transistor in a common-emitter configuration.

SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS
EQUATIONS
Consider the simple system of equations
7v 1 − 3v 2 − 4v 3 = −11
[1]
−3v 1 + 6v 2 − 2v 3 = 3 [2]
−4v 1 − 2v 2 + 11v 3 = 25 [3]
This set of equations could be solved by a systematic elimination of the
variables. Such a procedure is lengthy, however, and may never yield an-
swers if done unsystematically for a greater number of simultaneous equa-
tions. Fortunately, there are many more options available to us, some of
which we will explore in this appendix.
The Scientific Calculator
Perhaps the most straightforward approach when faced with a system of
equations such as Eqs. [1] to [3], in which we have numerical coefficients
and are only interested in the specific values of our unknowns (as opposed
to algebraic relationships), is to employ any of the various scientific calcu-
lators presently on the market. For example, on a Texas Instruments TI-84,
we can employ the Polynomial Root Finder and Simultaneous Equation
Solver (you may need to install the application using TI Connect TM ). Pressing
the APPS key and scrolling down, find the application named PLYSmlt2.
Running and continuing past the welcome screen shows the Main Menu of
Fig. A2.1a. Selecting the second menu item results in the screen shown in
Fig. A2.1b, where we have chosen three equations in three unknowns. After

APPENDIX 2 SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS
pressing NEXT, we are presented with a screen similar to that shown in
Fig. A2.1c. After we have finished entering all coefficients, pressing the
SOLVE button yields the Solution screen depicted in Fig. A2.1d. Since
we did not name the variables, a slight mental conversion is required to
realize X 1 = v 1 , X 2 = v 2 , etc.
It should be noted that each calculator capable of solving simultaneous
equations has its own procedure for entering the required information—
therefore, it is a good idea not to throw away anything marked ‘‘Owner’s
Manual’’ or ‘‘Instructions,’’ no matter how tempting such an action might be.
Matrices
Another powerful approach to the solution of a system of equations is based
on the concept of matrices. Consider Eqs. [1], [2], and [3]. The array of the
constant coefficients of the equations,
⎤
⎡
7 −3 −4
G = ⎣ −3
6 −2 ⎦
−4 −2 11
is called a matrix; the symbol G has been selected since each element of the
matrix is a conductance value. A matrix itself has no ‘‘value’’; it is merely
an ordered array of elements. We use a letter in boldface type to represent a
matrix, and we enclose the array itself by square brackets.
A matrix having m rows and n columns is called an (m × n) (pronounced
‘‘m by n’’) matrix. Thus,
2 0 5
−1 6 3
A =
is a (2 × 3) matrix, and the G matrix of our example is a (3 × 3) matrix. An
(n × n) matrix is a square matrix of order n.
An (m × 1) matrix is called a column matrix, or a vector. Thus,
V =
V 1
V 2
is a (2 × 1) column matrix of phasor voltages, and
I =
I 1
I 2
is a (2 × 1) phasor-current vector. A (1 × n) matrix is known as a row vector.
Two (m × n) matrices are equal if their corresponding elements are
equal. Thus, if a jk is that element of A located in row j and column k and
b jk is the element at row j and column k in matrix B, then A = B if and only
if a jk = b jk for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Thus, if
V 1
V 2
=
z 11 I 1 + z 12 I 2
z 21 I 1 + z 22 I 2
then V 1 = z 11 I 1 + z 12 I 2 and V 2 = z 21 I 1 + z 22 I 2 .APPENDIX 2 SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS
Two (m × n) matrices may be added by adding corresponding elements.

Next let us consider the matrix product AB, where A is an (m × n) matrix
and B is a ( p × q) matrix. If n = p, the matrices are said to be conformal,
and their product exists. That is, matrix multiplication is defined only for the
case where the number of columns of the first matrix in the product is equal
to the number of rows in the second matrix.
The formal definition of matrix multiplication states that the product of
the (m × n) matrix A and the (n × q) matrix B is an (m × q) matrix having
elements c jk , 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ k ≤ q, where
c jk = a j1 b 1k + a j2 b 2k + · · · + a jn b nk
That is, to find the element in the second row and third column of the prod-
uct, we multiply each of the elements in the second row of A by the corre-
sponding element in the third column of B and then add the n results. For
example, given the (2 × 3) matrix A and the (3 × 2) matrix B,
⎡
⎤
b 11 b 12
a 11 a 12 a 13 ⎣
b 21 b 22 ⎦ =
a 21 a 22 a 23
b 31 b 32
(a 11 b 11 + a 12 b 21 + a 13 b 31 ) (a 11 b 12 + a 12 b 22 + a 13 b 32 )
(a 21 b 11 + a 22 b 21 + a 23 b 31 ) (a 21 b 12 + a 22 b 22 + a 23 b 32 )
The result is a (2 × 2) matrix.
As a numerical example of matrix multiplication, we take

⎡

4 −3
where 6 = (3)(2) + (2)(−2) + (1)(4), 4 = (3)(3) + (2)(−1) + (1)(−3),
and so forth.
Matrix multiplication is not commutative. For example, given the
(3 × 2) matrix C and the (2 × 1) matrix D, it is evident that the product
CD may be calculated, but the product DC is not even defined.
As a final example, let
t A =

This procedure makes use of the identity G −1 G = I, where I is the identity
matrix, a square matrix of the same size as G, with zeros everywhere except
on the diagonal. Each element on the diagonal of an identity matrix is unity.
Thus, Eq. [5] becomes

since the identity matrix times any vector is simply equal to that vector (the
proof is left to the reader as a 30-second exercise). The solution of our system
of equations has therefore been transformed into the problem of obtaining the
inverse matrix of G. Many scientific calculators provide the means of per-
forming matrix algebra.APPENDIX 2 SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS
Returning to the TI-84, we press 2ND and MATRIX to obtain the
screen shown in Fig. A2.2a. Scrolling horizontally to EDIT, we press the
ENTER key, and select a 3 × 3 matrix, resulting in a screen similar to that
shown in Fig. A2.2b. Once we have finished entering the matrix, we press
2ND and QUIT. Returning to the MATRIX editor, we create a 3 ϫ 1 vec-
tor named B, as shown in Fig. A2.2c. We are now (finally) ready to solve for
the solution vector. Pressing 2ND and MATRIX, under NAMES we select
[A] and press ENTER, followed by the x −1 key. Next, we select [B] the
same way (we could have pressed the multiplication key in between but it is
not necessary). The result of our calculation is shown in Fig. A2.2d, and
agrees with our earlier exercise.

Determinants
Although a matrix itself has no ‘‘value,’’ the determinant of a square ma-
trix does have a value. To be precise, we should say that the determinant of
a matrix is a value, but common usage enables us to speak of both the array
itself and its value as the determinant. We shall symbolize a determinant
by , and employ a suitable subscript to denote the matrix to which the
determinant refers. Thus,
G
7 −3
= −3
6
−4 −2
−4
−2
11
Note that simple vertical lines are used to enclose the determinant.
The value of any determinant is obtained by expanding it in terms of its
minors. To do this, we select any row j or any column k, multiply each el-
ement in that row or column by its minor and by (−1) j+k , and then add the
products. The minor of the element appearing in both row j and column k
807808
APPENDIX 2 SOLUTION OF SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS
is the determinant obtained when row j and column k are removed; it is
indicated by jk .
As an example, let us expand the determinant G along column 3. We
first multiply the (−4) at the top of this column by (−1) 1+3 = 1 and then by
its minor:
(−4)(−1) 1+3
−3
6
−4 −2
and then repeat for the other two elements in column 3, adding the results:

−4 −2
−4 −2
−3
6
The minors contain only two rows and two columns. They are of order 2, and
their values are easily determined by expanding in terms of minors again,
here a trivial operation. Thus, for the first determinant, we expand along the
first column by multiplying (−3) by (−1) 1+1 and its minor, which is merely
the element (−2), and then multiplying (−4) by (−1) 2+1 and by 6. Thus,
−3
6
= (−3)(−2) − 4(−6) = 30
−4 −2
It is usually easier to remember the result for a second-order determinant as
‘‘upper left times lower right minus upper right times lower left.’’ Finally,
G
= −4[(−3)(−2) − 6(−4)]
+ 2[(7)(−2) − (−3)(−4)]
+ 11[(7)(6) − (−3)(−3)]
= −4(30) + 2(−26) + 11(33)
= 191
For practice, let us expand this same determinant along the first row:
G

The expansion by minors is valid for a determinant of any order.
Repeating these rules for evaluating a determinant in more general
terms, we would say, given a matrix a,
⎤
⎡

have

Cramer’s Rule
We next consider Cramer’s rule, which enables us to find the values of the
unknown variables. It is also useful in solving systems of equations where
numerical coefficients have not yet been specified, thus confounding our
calculators. Let us again consider Eqs. [1], [2], and [3]; we define the deter-
minant 1 as that determinant which is obtained when the first column of

A PROOF OF THÉVENIN’S
THEOREM
Here we prove Thévenin’s theorem in the same form in which it is stated in
Sec. 5.4 of Chap. 5:
Given any linear circuit, rearrange it in the form of two networks A and
B connected by two wires. Define a voltage v oc as the open-circuit volt-
age which appears across the terminals of A when B is disconnected.
Then all currents and voltages in B will remain unchanged if all inde-
pendent voltage and current sources in A are ‘‘killed’’ or ‘‘zeroed out,’’
and an independent voltage source v oc is connected, with proper polar-
ity, in series with the dead (inactive) A network.
We will effect our proof by showing that the original A network and the
Thévenin equivalent of the A network both cause the same current to flow
into the terminals of the B network. If the currents are the same, then the
voltages must be the same; in other words, if we apply a certain current,
which we might think of as a current source, to the B network, then the cur-
rent source and the B network constitute a circuit that has a specific input
voltage as a response. Thus, the current determines the voltage. Alterna-
tively we could, if we wished, show that the terminal voltage at B is
unchanged, because the voltage also determines the current uniquely. If the
input voltage and current to the B network are unchanged, then it follows
that the currents and voltages throughout the B network are also unchanged.
Let us first prove the theorem for the case where the B network is inactive
(no independent sources). After this step has been accomplished, we may then
use the superposition principle to extend the theorem to include B networks
that contain independent sources. Each network may contain dependent
sources, provided that their control variables are in the same network.
The current i , flowing in the upper conductor from the A network to the
B network in Fig. A3.1a, is therefore caused entirely by the independent

v x = v oc . The Thévenin source thus produces a current −i while network A provides i . (c ) The Thévenin source is reversed and network A is killed.
The current is therefore i .

sources present in the A network. Suppose now that we add an additional
voltage source v x , which we shall call the Thévenin source, in the conduc-
tor in which i is measured, as shown in Fig. A3.1b, and then adjust the mag-
nitude and time variation of v x until the current is reduced to zero. By our
definition of v oc , then, the voltage across the terminals of A must be v oc ,
since i = 0. Network B contains no independent sources, and no current is
entering its terminals; therefore, there is no voltage across the terminals of
the B network, and by Kirchhoff’s voltage law the voltage of the Thévenin
source is v oc volts, v x = v oc . Moreover, since the Thévenin source and the
A network jointly deliver no current to B, and since the A network by itself
delivers a current i , superposition requires that the Thévenin source acting
by itself must deliver a current of −i to B. The source acting alone in a
reversed direction, as shown in Fig. A3.1c, therefore produces a current i in
the upper lead. This situation, however, is the same as the conclusion
reached by Thévenin’s theorem: the Thévenin source v oc acting in series
with the inactive A network is equivalent to the given network.
Now let us consider the case where the B network may be an active net-
work. We now think of the current i , flowing from the A network to the B
network in the upper conductor, as being composed of two parts, i A and i B ,
where i A is the current produced by A acting alone and the current i B is due
to B acting alone. Our ability to divide the current into these two compo-
nents is a direct consequence of the applicability of the superposition
principle to these two linear networks; the complete response and the two
partial responses are indicated by the diagrams of Fig. A3.2.

■ FIGURE A3.2 Superposition enables the current i to be considered as the sum of two partial responses.
The partial response i A has already been considered; if network B is in-
active, we know that network A may be replaced by the Thévenin source and
the inactive A network. In other words, of the three sources which we must
keep in mind—those in A, those in B, and the Thévenin source—the partial
response i A occurs when A and B are dead and the Thévenin source is active.
Preparing for the use of superposition, we now let A remain inactive, but
turn on B and turn off the Thévenin source; by definition, the partial re-
sponse i B is obtained. Superimposing the results, the response when A is
dead and both the Thévenin source and B are active is i A + i B . This sum is
the original current i, and the situation wherein the Thévenin source and B
are active but A is dead is the desired Thévenin equivalent circuit. Thus the
active network A may be replaced by its Thévenin source, the open-circuit
voltage, in series with the inactive A network, regardless of the status of the
B network; it may be either active or inactive.APPENDIX

A PSpice ® TUTORIAL
SPICE is an acronym for Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit
Emphasis. A powerful program, it is an industry standard and used through-
out the world for a variety of circuit analysis applications. SPICE was origi-
nally developed in the early 1970s by Donald O. Peterson and coworkers at
the University of California at Berkeley. Interestingly, Peterson advocated
free and unhindered distribution of knowledge created in university labs,
choosing to make an impact as opposed to profiting financially. In 1984,
MicroSim Corporation introduced a PC version of SPICE called PSpice ® ,
which built intuitive graphical interfaces around the core SPICE software
routines. There are now several variations of SPICE available commercially,
as well as competing software products.
The goal of this appendix is to simply introduce the basics of computer-
aided circuit analysis; more details are presented in the main text as well as
in the references listed under Reading Further. Advanced topics covered in
the references include how to determine the sensitivity of an output variable
to changes in a specific component value; how to obtain plots of the output
versus a source value; determining ac output as a function of source fre-
quency; methods for performing noise and distortion analyses; nonlinear
component models; and how to model temperature effects on specific types
of circuits.
The acquisition of MicroSim by OrCAD, and the subsequent acquisition
of OrCAD by Cadence, has led to quite a few changes in this popular cir-
cuit simulation package. At the time of this writing, OrCAD Capture
CIS-Demo 16.3, is the current professional release; a scaled-back version is
available for free download (www.cadence.com). This new version
replaces the popular PSpice Student Release 9.1, and although slightly dif-
ferent, particularly in terms of the schematic editing, should seem generally
familiar to users of previous PSpice releases.
The documentation which accompanies the demo version of OrCAD 16.3
lists several restrictions that do not apply to the professional (commercially
available) version. The most significant is that only circuits having 60 or
fewer parts may be saved and simulated; larger circuits can be drawn and
viewed, however. We have chosen to work with the OrCAD Capture
schematics editor, as the current version is very similar fundamentally to the
PSpice A/D Schematic Capture editor. Although at present Cadence also
provides PSpice A/D for download, it is no longer supported.
Getting Started
A computer-aided circuit analysis consists of three separate steps: (1) draw-
ing the schematic, (2) simulating the circuit, and (3) extracting the desired
information from the simulation output. The OrCAD Capture schematic
813814

editor is launched through the Windows programs list found under the
menu; upon selecting OrCAD Capture CIS-Demo, the schematics
editor opens, as shown in Fig. A4.1.
■ FIGURE A4.1 Capture CIS-Demo window.
Under the File menu, select New, then Project; the window of
Fig. A4.2a appears. After providing a simulation filename and a directory
path, the window of Fig. A4.2b appears (simply select the “blank project”
option). We are now presented with the main schematics editor window, as
in Fig. A4.3.

At this point, we’re ready to draw a circuit, so let’s try a simple voltage
divider for purposes of illustration. We will first place the necessary com-
ponents on the grid, and then wire them together.
Pulling down the Place menu, we choose Part. Typing a lowercase ‘‘r’’
as shown, we click OK and are now able to move a resistor symbol around
the schematic window using the mouse. A single left click places a resistor
(named R1) at the mouse location; a second left click places a second resis-
tor on our schematic (named R2). A single right click and selecting End
Mode cancel further resistor placements. The second resistor does not have
the appropriate orientation, but is easily manipulated by highlighting it with
a single right click, then selecting Rotate. If we do not know the name of
the desired part, we can browse through the library of parts provided. If
1 k resistors are not desired—for example, perhaps two 500 resistors
were called for—we change the default values simply by double-clicking
the ‘‘1k’’ next to the appropriate symbol.
No voltage divider circuit is complete of course without a voltage source
(vsrc). Double-clicking DC=, we choose a value of 9 V for our source. One
further component is required: SPICE requires a reference (or ground) node to
be specified. Clicking the GND symbol to the far right of the schematic win-
dow, we choose 0/Source from the options. Our progress so far is shown in
Fig. A4.4a; all that remains is to wire the components together. This is
accomplished by selecting the Place wire (W) icon. The left and right mouse
keys control each wire (some experimenting is called for here—afterward, se-
lect any unwanted wire segments and hit the Delete key). Our final circuit is
shown in Fig. A4.4b. It is worth noting that the editor will allow the user to wire
through a resistor (thus shorting it out), which can be difficult to see. Generally
a warning symbol appears before wiring to an inappropriate location.
Prior to simulating our circuit, we save it by clicking the save icon or
selecting Save from the File menu. From the PSpice menu, we select New
Simulation Profile and type Voltage Divider in the dialog box that appears.

The Simulation Settings dialog box that appears allows us to set parameters
for a variety of types of simulations; for the present example we need to select
Bias Point under the Analysis type menu. Once again pulling down the
PSpice menu, we select Run. The simulation results are shown in Fig. A4.5.

Fortunately, our simulation yields the expected result—an even split of
our source voltage across the two equal-valued resistors. We can also view
the simulation results by selecting View Output File under the PSpice

COMPLEX NUMBERS
This appendix includes sections covering the definition of a complex num-
ber, the basic arithmetic operations for complex numbers, Euler’s identity,
and the exponential and polar forms of the complex number. We first intro-
duce the concept of a complex number.
A5.1 THE COMPLEX NUMBER
•
Our early training in mathematics dealt exclusively with real numbers, such
as 4, − 27 , and π . Soon, however, we began to encounter algebraic equations,
such as x 2 = −3, which could not be satisfied by any real number. Such an
equation can be solved only through the introduction of the imaginary unit,
or the imaginary operator, which we
√ shall designate by the symbol j . By
definition, j 2 = −1, and thus j = −1, j 3 = − j , j 4 = 1, and so forth.
The product of a real number and the imaginary operator is called an imag-
inary number, and the sum of a real number and an imaginary number is
called a complex number. Thus, a number having the form a + jb, where a
and b are real numbers, is a complex number.
We shall designate a complex number by means of a special single sym-
bol; thus, A = a + jb. The complex nature of the number is indicated by
the use of boldface type; in handwritten material, a bar over the letter is cus-
tomary. The complex number A just shown is described as having a real
component or real part a and an imaginary component or imaginary part b.
This is also expressed as
Re{A} = a
Mathematicians designate the imaginary operator by
the symbol i , but it is customary to use j in electrical
engineering in order to avoid confusion with the
symbol for current.
The choice of the words imaginary and complex
is unfortunate. They are used here and in the
mathematical literature as technical terms to designate
a class of numbers. To interpret imaginary as ‘‘not
pertaining to the physical world’’ or complex as
‘‘complicated’’ is neither justified nor intended.
Im{A} = b
The imaginary component of A is not jb. By definition, the imaginary com-
ponent is a real number.
It should be noted that all real numbers may be regarded as complex
numbers having imaginary parts equal to zero. The real numbers are there-
fore included in the system of complex numbers, and we may now consider
them as a special case. When we define the fundamental arithmetic opera-
tions for complex numbers, we should therefore expect them to reduce to
the corresponding definitions for real numbers if the imaginary part of every
complex number is set equal to zero.
Since any complex number is completely characterized by a pair of real
numbers, such as a and b in the previous example, we can obtain some
visual assistance by representing a complex number graphically on a rec-
tangular, or Cartesian, coordinate system. By providing ourselves with a real
axis and an imaginary axis, as shown in Fig. A5.1, we form a complex
plane, or Argand diagram, on which any complex number can be repre-
sented as a single point. The complex numbers M = 3 + j1 and N = 2 − j2

are indicated. It is important to understand that this complex plane is only
a visual aid; it is not at all essential to the mathematical statements which
follow.

■ FIGURE A5.1 The complex numbers M = 3 + j1 and
N = 2 − j2 are shown on the complex plane.
We define two complex numbers as being equal if, and only if, their real
parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Graphically, then, to
each point in the complex plane there corresponds only one complex num-
ber, and conversely, to each complex number there corresponds only one
point in the complex plane. Thus, suppose we are given the two complex
numbers
A = a + jb
and
B = c + jd
Then, if
A = B
it is necessary that
a = c
and
b = d
A complex number expressed as the sum of a real number and an imaginary
number, such as A = a + jb, is said to be in rectangular or cartesian form.
Other forms for a complex number will appear shortly.
Let us now define the fundamental operations of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division for complex numbers. The sum of two complex
numbers is defined as the complex number whose real part is the sum of the
real parts of the two complex numbers and whose imaginary part is the sum
of the imaginary parts of the two complex numbers. Thus,
(a + jb) + (c + jd) = (a + c) + j (b + d)
For example,
(3 + j4) + (4 − j2) = 7 + j2
The difference of two complex numbers is taken in a similar manner; for
example,
(3 + j4) − (4 − j2) = −1 + j6819
APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers may also be accomplished
graphically on the complex plane. Each complex number is represented as
a vector, or directed line segment, and the sum is obtained by completing
the parallelogram, illustrated by Fig. A5.2a, or by connecting the vectors in
a head-to-tail manner, as shown in Fig. A5.2b. A graphical sketch is often
useful as a check for a more exact numerical solution.
The product of two complex numbers is defined by
Imaginary
M
Real
M + N = 5 – j1
(a + jb)(c + jd) = (ac − bd) + j (bc + ad)
This result may be easily obtained by a direct multiplication of the two
binomial terms, using the rules of the algebra of real numbers, and then
simplifying the result by letting j 2 = −1. For example,
(3 + j4)(4 − j2) = 12 − j6 + j16 − 8 j 2
= 12 + j10 + 8
= 20 + j10
It is easier to multiply the complex numbers by this method, particularly if
we immediately replace j 2 by −1, than it is to substitute in the general for-
mula that defines the multiplication.
Before defining the operation of division for complex numbers, we
should define the conjugate of a complex number. The conjugate of the
complex number A = a + jb is a − jb and is represented as A ∗ . The con-
jugate of any complex number is therefore easily obtained by merely chang-
ing the sign of the imaginary part of the complex number. Thus, if
A = 5 + j3

numbers M = 3 + j 1 and N = 2 − j 2 is obtained
by constructing a parallelogram. (b) The sum of the
same two complex numbers is found by a head-to-tail
combination.
then
A ∗ = 5 − j3
It is evident that the conjugate of any complicated complex expression may
be found by replacing every complex term in the expression by its conju-
gate, which may be obtained by replacing every j in the expression by − j .
The definitions of addition, subtraction, and multiplication show that the
following statements are true: the sum of a complex number and its conju-
gate is a real number; the difference of a complex number and its conjugate
is an imaginary number; and the product of a complex number and its
conjugate is a real number. It is also evident that if A ∗ is the conjugate of A,
then A is the conjugate of A ∗ ; in other words, A = (A ∗ ) ∗ . A complex
number and its conjugate are said to form a conjugate complex pair of
numbers.
We now define the quotient of two complex numbers:
A
(A)(B ∗ )
=
B
(B)(B ∗ )
and thus
a + jb
(ac + bd) + j (bc − ad)
=
c + jd
c 2 + d 2
Inevitably in a physical problem a complex number is
somehow accompanied by its conjugate.820
APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
We multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the de-
nominator in order to obtain a denominator which is real; this process is
called rationalizing the denominator. As a numerical example,
(3 + j4)(4 + j2)
3 + j4
=
4 − j2
(4 − j2)(4 + j2)
4 + j22
= 0.2 + j1.1

16 + 4
The addition or subtraction of two complex numbers which are each ex-
pressed in rectangular form is a relatively simple operation; multiplication
or division of two complex numbers in rectangular form, however, is a
rather unwieldy process. These latter two operations will be found to be
much simpler when the complex numbers are given in either exponential or
polar form. These forms will be introduced in Secs. A5.3 and A5.4.

A5.2 EULER’S IDENTITY
•
In Chap. 9 we encounter functions of time which contain complex numbers,
and we are concerned with the differentiation and integration of these func-
tions with respect to the real variable t. We differentiate and integrate such
functions with respect to t by exactly the same procedures we use for real
functions of time. That is, the complex constants are treated just as though
they were real constants when performing the operations of differentiation
or integration. If f(t) is a complex function of time, such as
f(t) = a cos ct + jb sin ct
then
df(t)
= −ac sin ct + jbc cos ct
dt
and
f(t) dt =
a
b
sin ct − j cos ct + C

c
where the constant of integration C is a complex number in general.
It is sometimes necessary to differentiate or integrate a function of a
complex variable with respect to that complex variable. In general, the
successful accomplishment of either of these operations requires that theAPPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
function which is to be differentiated or integrated satisfy certain condi-
tions. All our functions do meet these conditions, and integration or differ-
entiation with respect to a complex variable is achieved by using methods
identical to those used for real variables.
At this time we must make use of a very important fundamental rela-
tionship known as Euler’s identity (pronounced ‘‘oilers’’). We shall prove
this identity, for it is extremely useful in representing a complex number in
a form other than rectangular form.
The proof is based on the power series expansions of cos θ , sin θ , and e z ,
given toward the back of your favorite college calculus text:

We conclude that
e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ
[1]
or, if we let z = − jθ , we find that
e − jθ = cos θ − j sin θ
[2]
By adding and subtracting Eqs. [1] and [2], we obtain the two expressions
which we use without proof in our study of the underdamped natural
response of the parallel and series RLC circuits,

A5.3 THE EXPONENTIAL FORM
•
Let us now take Euler’s identity
e jθ = cos θ + j sin θ
and multiply each side by the real positive number C:
Ce jθ = C cos θ + jC sin θ
[5]
The right-hand side of Eq. [5] consists of the sum of a real number and an
imaginary number and thus represents a complex number in rectangular
form; let us call this complex number A, where A = a + jb. By equating
the real parts
a = C cos θ [6]
b = C sin θ [7]
and the imaginary parts
then squaring and adding Eqs. [6] and [7],
a 2 + b 2 = C 2
or
C = + a 2 + b 2
[8]
and dividing Eq. [7] by Eq. [6]:
b
= tan θ
a
or
θ = tan −1
b
a
[9]
we obtain the relationships of Eqs. [8] and [9], which enable us to determine
C and θ from a knowledge of a and b. For example, if A = 4 + j2, then we
identify a as 4 and b as 2 and find C and θ :
C =
4 2 + 2 2 = 4.47
θ = tan −1
2
4
= 26.6 ◦
We could use this new information to write A in the form
A = 4.47 cos 26.6 ◦ + j4.47 sin 26.6 ◦
but it is the form of the left-hand side of Eq. [5] which will prove to be the
more useful:
◦
A = Ce jθ = 4.47e j26.6
A complex number expressed in this manner is said to be in exponential
form. The real positive multiplying factor C is known as the amplitude or
magnitude, and the real quantity θ appearing in the exponent is called the
argument or angle. A mathematician would always express θ in radians and
would write
A = 4.47e j0.464823
APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
but engineers customarily work in terms of degrees. The use of the degree
symbol ( ◦ ) in the exponent should make confusion impossible.
To recapitulate, if we have a complex number which is given in rectan-
gular form,
A = a + jb
and wish to express it in exponential form,
A = Ce jθ
we may find C and θ by Eqs. [8] and [9]. If we are given the complex num-
ber in exponential form, then we may find a and b by Eqs. [6] and [7].
When A is expressed in terms of numerical values, the transformation
between exponential (or polar) and rectangular forms is available as a built-
in operation on most handheld scientific calculators.
One question will be found to arise in the determination of the angle θ
by using the arctangent relationship of Eq. [9]. This function is multivalued,
and an appropriate angle must be selected from various possibilities. One
method by which the choice may be made is to select an angle for which the
sine and cosine have the proper signs to produce the required values of a
and b from Eqs. [6] and [7]. For example, let us convert
V = 4 − j3
to exponential form. The amplitude is
C =
Imaginary
4 2 + (−3) 2 = 5
and the angle is
θ = tan −1
−3
4
C = a 2 + b 2
[10]
A value of θ has to be selected which leads to a positive value for cos θ , since
4 = 5 cos θ , and a negative value for sin θ , since −3 = 5 sin θ . We therefore
obtain θ = −36.9 ◦ , 323.1 ◦ , −396.9 ◦ , and so forth. Any of these angles is
correct, and we usually select that one which is the simplest, here, −36.9 ◦ . We
should note that the alternative solution of Eq. [10], θ = 143.1 ◦ , is not
correct, because cos θ is negative and sin θ is positive.
A simpler method of selecting the correct angle is available if we repre-
sent the complex number graphically in the complex plane. Let us first se-
lect a complex number, given in rectangular form, A = a + jb, which lies
in the first quadrant of the complex plane, as illustrated in Fig. A5.3. If we
draw a line from the origin to the point which represents the complex num-
ber, we shall have constructed a right triangle whose hypotenuse is evi-
dently the amplitude of the √ exponential representation of the complex num-
ber. In other words, C = a 2 + b 2 . Moreover, the counterclockwise angle
which the line makes with the positive real axis is seen to be the angle θ of
the exponential representation, because a = C cos θ and b = C sin θ . Now
if we are given the rectangular form of a complex number which lies in an-
other quadrant, such as V = 4 − j3, which is depicted in Fig. A5.4, the cor-
rect angle is graphically evident, either −36.9 ◦ or 323.1 ◦ for this example.
The sketch may often be visualized and need not be drawn.

APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
If the rectangular form of the complex number has a negative real part,
it is often easier to work with the negative of the complex number, thus
avoiding angles greater than 90 ◦ in magnitude. For example, given
I = −5 + j2
we write
I = −(5 − j2)
and then transform (5 − j2) to exponential form:
I = −Ce jθ
where
C =
√
29 = 5.39
and
θ = tan −1
−2
5
= −21.8 ◦
We therefore have
◦
I = −5.39e − j21.8
The negative sign may be removed from the complex number by increasing
or decreasing the angle by 180 ◦ , as shown by reference to a sketch in the
complex plane. Thus, the result may be expressed in exponential form as
◦
I = 5.39e j158.2
or
◦
I = 5.39e − j201.8
Note that use of an electronic calculator in the inverse tangent mode always
yields angles having magnitudes less than 90 ◦ . Thus, both tan −1 [(−3)/4] and
tan −1 [3/(−4)] come out as −36.9 ◦ . Calculators that provide rectangular-to-
polar conversion, however, give the correct angle in all cases.
One last remark about the exponential representation of a complex num-
ber should be made. Two complex numbers, both written in exponential
form, are equal if, and only if, their amplitudes are equal and their angles are
equivalent. Equivalent angles are those which differ by multiples of 360 ◦ .
For example, if A = Ce jθ and B = De jφ , then if A = B, it is necessary that
C = D and θ = φ ± (360 ◦ )n, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .

A5.4 THE POLAR FORM
•
The third (and last) form in which we may represent a complex number is
essentially the same as the exponential form, except for a slight difference
in symbolism. We use an angle sign (/ ) to replace the combination e j . Thus,APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
the exponential representation of a complex number A,
A = Ce jθ
may be written somewhat more concisely as
A = C/θ
The complex number is now said to be expressed in polar form, a name
which suggests the representation of a point in a (complex) plane through
the use of polar coordinates.
It is apparent that transformation from rectangular to polar form or from
polar form to rectangular form is basically the same as transformation
between rectangular and exponential form. The same relationships exist
between C, θ , a, and b.
The complex number
A = −2 + j5
is thus written in exponential form as
◦
A = 5.39e j111.8
and in polar form as
A = 5.39/111.8 ◦
In order to appreciate the utility of the exponential and polar forms, let us
consider the multiplication and division of two complex numbers repre-
sented in exponential or polar form. If we are given
A = 5/53.1 ◦
B = 15/−36.9 ◦
and
then the expression of these two complex numbers in exponential form
◦
A = 5e j53.1
◦
B = 15e − j36.9
and
enables us to write the product as a complex number in exponential form
whose amplitude is the product of the amplitudes and whose angle is the
algebraic sum of the angles, in accordance with the normal rules for multi-
plying two exponential quantities:
◦
◦
(A)(B) = (5)(15)e j (53.1 −36.9 )
or
◦
AB = 75e j16.2 = 75/16.2 ◦
From the definition of the polar form, it is evident that
A
= 0.333/90 ◦
B
Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are accomplished most eas-
ily by operating on complex numbers in rectangular form, and the addition
or subtraction of two complex numbers given in exponential or polar form
should begin with the conversion of the two complex numbers to rectangu-
lar form. The reverse situation applies to multiplication and division; two
825826
APPENDIX 5 COMPLEX NUMBERS
numbers given in rectangular form should be transformed to polar form, un-
less the numbers happen to be small integers. For example, if we wish to
multiply (1 − j3) by (2 + j1), it is easier to multiply them directly as they
stand and obtain (5 − j5). If the numbers can be multiplied mentally, then
time is wasted in transforming them to polar form.
We should now endeavor to become familiar with the three different
forms in which complex numbers may be expressed and with the rapid con-
version from one form to another. The relationships among the three forms
seem almost endless, and the following lengthy equation summarizes the
various interrelationships
A = a + jb = Re{A} + jIm{A} = Ce jθ =
=
−1
a 2 + b 2 e j tan
(b/a)
a 2 + b 2 / tan −1 (b/a)
Most of the conversions from one form to another can be done quickly with
the help of a calculator, and many calculators are equipped to solve linear
equations with complex numbers.
We shall find that complex numbers are a convenient mathematical arti-
fice which facilitates the analysis of real physical situations.

A BRIEF MATLAB ® TUTORIAL
The intention of this tutorial is to provide a very brief introduction to some
basic concepts required to use a powerful software package known as
MATLAB. The use of MATLAB is a completely optional part of the mate-
rial in this textbook, but as it is becoming an increasingly common tool in
all areas of electrical engineering, we felt that it was worthwhile to provide
students with the opportunity to begin exploring some of its features, par-
ticularly in plotting 2D and 3D functions, performing matrix operations,
solving simultaneous equations, and manipulating algebraic expressions.
Many institutions now provide the full version of MATLAB for their stu-
dents, but at the time of this writing, a student version is available at
reduced cost from The MathWorks, Inc. (http://www.mathworks.com/
academia/student_version/).
Getting Started
MATLAB is launched by clicking on the program icon; the typical opening
window is shown in Fig. A6.1. Programs may be run from files or by
directly entering commands in the window. MATLAB also has extensive
online help resources, useful for both beginners and advanced users alike.
Typical MATLAB programs very much resemble programs written in C,
although familiarity with this language is by no means required.

APPENDIX 6 A BRIEF MATLAB ® TUTORIAL
Variables and Mathematical Operations
MATLAB makes a great deal more sense once the user realizes that all vari-
ables are matrices, even if simply 1 × 1 matrices. Variable names can be up
to 19 characters in length, which is extremely useful in constructing pro-
grams with adequate readability. The first character must be a letter, but all
remaining characters can be any letter or number; the underscore (_)
character may also be used. Variable names in MATLAB are case-sensitive.
MATLAB includes several predefined variables. Relevant predefined vari-
ables for the material presented in this text include:
eps
realmin
realmax
inf
NaN
pi
i , j
The machine accuracy
The smallest (positive) floating-point number handled by the
computer
The largest floating-point number handled by the computer
Infinity (defined as 1Ͳ0)
Literally, ‘‘Not a Number.’’ This includes situations such as 0/0
π (3.14159 . . .)
Both are initially defined as
values by the user
√
−1 . They may be assigned other
A complete list of currently defined variables can be obtained with the com-
mand who. Variables are assigned by using an equal sign (=). If the state-
ment is terminated with a semicolon (;), then another prompt appears. If the
statement is simply terminated by a carriage return (i.e., by pressing the En-
ter key), then the variable is repeated. For example,
Second color has been used to differentiate program-
generated text from user-generated text for the
convenience of the reader only. We should note that
the most recent versions of MATLAB use color to
separate different types of text (functions, variables,
etc.) and to highlight potential typographical errors.
EDU» input_voltage = 5;
EDU» input_current = 1e−3
input_current =
1.0000e−003
EDU»
Complex variables are easy to define in MATLAB: for example,
EDU» s = 9 + j*5;
creates a complex variable s with value 9 + j5.
A matrix other than a 1 × 1 matrix is defined using brackets. For example,
we would express the matrix t = 2 3 −1 0 in MATLAB as
EDU» t = [2
− 1; 3 0];
Note that the matrix elements are entered a row at a time; row elements are
separated by a space, and rows are separated by a semicolon (;). The same
arithmetic operations are available for matrices; so, for example, we may
find t + t as
EDU» t + t
ans =
4 −2

Arithmetic operators include:
∧
∗
/
\
+
−
power
multiplication
right (ordinary) division
left division
addition
subtraction
The order of operations is important. The order of precedence is power, then
multiplication and division, then addition and subtraction.
1 + 5^2 *3
EDU» x
x =
76
The concept of left division may seem strange at first, but is very useful in
matrix algebra. For example,
EDU» 1/5
ans =
0.2000
EDU» 1\5
ans =
5
EDU» 5\1
ans =
0.2000
And, in the case of the matrix equation Ax = B, where
A =
2 4
1 6
and
B =
−1
2
we find x with
EDU» A = [2 4; 1 6];
EDU» B = [−1; 2];
EDU» x = A\B
x =
−1.7500
0.6250
Alternatively, we can also write
EDU» x = A^−1*B
x =
−1.7500
0.6250
829830
APPENDIX 6 A BRIEF MATLAB ® TUTORIAL
or
EDU» inv(A)*B
ans =
−1.7500
0.6250
When in doubt, parentheses can help a great deal.
Some Useful Functions
Space requirements prevent us from listing every function contained in
MATLAB. Some of the more basic ones include:
abs(x)
exp(x)
sqrt(x)
log(x)
|x|
e x
√
x
ln x
log 10(x)
sin(x)
cos(x)
tan(x)
log 10 x
sin x
cos x
tan x
asin(x)
acos(x)
atan(x)
sin −1 x
cos −1 x
tan −1 x
Functions useful for manipulating complex variables include:
real(s)
imag(s)
Re{s}
Im{s}
√
a 2 + b 2 , where s ≡ a + jb
tan −1 (b/a), where s ≡ a + jb
complex conjugate of s
abs(s)
angle(s)
conj(s)
Another extremely useful command, often forgotten, is simply help.
Occasionally we require a vector, such as when we plan to create a plot.
The command linspace(min, max, number of points) is invaluable in such
instances:
EDU» frequency = linspace(0,10,5)
frequency =
0
2.5000
5.0000
7.5000
10.0000
A useful cousin is the command logspace().
Generating Plots
Plotting with MATLAB is extremely easy. For example, Fig. A6.2 shows
the result of executing the following MATLAB program:
EDU» x = linspace(0,2*pi,100);
EDU» y = sin(x);
EDU» plot(x,y);
EDU» xlabel('Angle (radians)');
EDU» ylabel('f(x)');APPENDIX 6 A BRIEF MATLAB ® TUTORIAL
■ FIGURE A6.2 An example plot of sin(x), 0 < x < 2π,
generated using MATLAB. The variable x is a vector comprised
of 100 equally spaced elements.
Writing Programs
Although the MATLAB examples in this text are presented as lines typed
into the Command Window, it is possible (and often prudent, if repetition
is an issue) to write a program so that calculations are more convenient.
This is accomplished in MATLAB by writing what is termed an m-file.
This is simply a text file saved with a ‘‘.m’’ extension (for example,
first_program.m). In a nod to Kernighan and Ritchie, we pull down New
Script under the File menu, which opens up the editor. (Note that you can
use another editor, for example, WordPad, if you prefer.)
We type in
r = input('Hello, World')
as shown in Fig. A6.3.
■ FIGURE A6.3 Example m-file created in m-file editor.
831832
APPENDIX 6 A BRIEF MATLAB ® TUTORIAL
We next save it as first_program in a convenient directory, taking care to
select MATLAB Files (*.m) under File Type. Under the File menu, we select
Open, and find first_program.m. This reopens the editor (so we could have
skipped closing it earlier). We run our program by hitting f5 or selecting Run
under the Debug menu. In the Command Window, we see our greeting;
MATLAB is waiting for a keyboard response, so just hit the Enter key.
Let’s expand a previous example to allow the magnitude to be user-
selected as in Fig. A6.4. We are now allowed to enter an arbitrary amplitude
for our plot.
■ FIGURE A6.4 Example m-file named example1.m for
generating sine wave plot.
We leave it to the reader to choose when to write a program/m-file and
when to simply use the Command Window directly.

ADDITIONAL LAPLACE
TRANSFORM THEOREMS
In this appendix, we briefly present several Laplace transform theorems
typically used in more advanced situations in addition to those described in
Chap. 14.
Transforms of Periodic Time Functions
The time-shift theorem is very useful in evaluating the transform of periodic
time functions. Suppose that f (t) is periodic with a period T for positive
values of t. The behavior of f (t) for t < 0 has no effect on the (one-sided)
Laplace transform, as we know. Thus, f (t) can be written as
f (t) = f (t − nT )
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
If we now define a new time function which is nonzero only in the first
period of f (t),
f 1 (t) = [u(t) − u(t − T )] f (t)
then the original f (t) can be represented as the sum of an infinite number of
such functions, delayed by integral multiples of T . That is,
f (t) = [u(t) − u(t − T )] f (t) + [u(t − T ) − u(t − 2T )] f (t)
+ [u(t − 2T ) − u(t − 3T )] f (t) + · · ·
= f 1 (t) + f 1 (t − T ) + f 1 (t − 2T ) + · · ·
or
∞
f (t) =
f 1 (t − nT )
n=0
The Laplace transform of this sum is just the sum of the transforms,
F(s) =
∞
{ f 1 (t − nT )}
n=0
so that the time-shift theorem leads to
F(s) =
∞
e −nT s F 1 (s)
n=0
where
F 1 (s) =
{ f 1 (t)} =
T
0 −
e −st f (t) dt
833834
APPENDIX 7 ADDITIONAL LAPLACE TRANSFORM THEOREMS
Since F 1 (s) is not a function of n, it can be removed from the summation,
and F(s) becomes
F(s) = F 1 (s)[1 + e −T s + e −2T s + · · ·]
When we apply the binomial theorem to the bracketed expression, it sim-
plifies to 1/(1 − e −T s ). Thus, we conclude that the periodic function f (t),
with period T, has a Laplace transform expressed by
F(s) =
F 1 (s)
1 − e −T s
[1]
where
F 1 (s) =
{[u(t) − u(t − T )] f (t)}
[2]
is the transform of the first period of the time function.
To illustrate the use of this transform theorem for periodic functions, let
us apply it to the familiar rectangular pulse train, Fig. A7.1. We may de-
scribe this periodic function analytically:
v(t) =
∞
V 0 [u(t − nT ) − u(t − nT − τ )]

■ FIGURE A7.1 A periodic train of rectangular pulses
for which F(s) = (V 0 /s)(1 − e −sτ )/(1 − e −sT ) .
The function V 1 (s) is simple to calculate:
V 1 (s) = V 0
τ
0 −
e −st dt =
V 0
(1 − e −sτ )
s
Now, to obtain the desired transform, we just divide by (1 − e −sT ):
V(s) =
V 0 (1 − e −sτ )
s(1 − e −sT )
[3]
We should note how several different theorems show up in the transform in
Eq. [3]. The (1 − e −sT ) factor in the denominator accounts for the periodic-
ity of the function, the e −sτ term in the numerator arises from the time de-
lay of the negative square wave that turns off the pulse, and the V 0 /s factor
is, of course, the transform of the step functions involved in v(t).835
APPENDIX 7 ADDITIONAL LAPLACE TRANSFORM THEOREMS
EXAMPLE A7.1
Determine the transform of the periodic function of Fig. A7.2.
f (t)
We begin by writing an equation which describes f (t), a function
composed of alternating positive and negative impulse functions.

There are several ways to evaluate this integral. The easiest is to
recognize that its value will remain the same if the upper limit is
increased to ∞, allowing us to make use of the time-shift theorem.
Thus,
F 1 (s) = 2[e −s − e −3s ]

e −st e −at f (t) dt =

Looking carefully at this result, we note that the integral on the right is iden-
tical to that defining F(s) with one exception: (s + a) appears in place of s.
Thus,
e −at f (t) ⇔ F(s + a)

APPENDIX 7 ADDITIONAL LAPLACE TRANSFORM THEOREMS
We conclude that replacing s by (s + a) in the frequency domain corresponds
to multiplication by e −at in the time domain. This is known as the frequency-
shift theorem. It can be put to immediate use in evaluating the transform of
the exponentially damped cosine function that we used extensively in previ-
ous work. Beginning with the known transform of the cosine function,
{cos ω 0 t} = F(s) =

s 2 + ω 0 2
then the transform of e −at cos ω 0 t must be F(s + a):

that differentiation with respect to s in the frequency domain results in mul-

Suppose now that f (t) is the unit-ramp function tu(t), whose transform we
